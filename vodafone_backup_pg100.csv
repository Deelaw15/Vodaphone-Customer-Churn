It was a joy to deal with him and I left the branch exceptionally happy and more than satisfied by the service I received from this staff member. I am sure he fits the exact profile of your company and I feel sure he has the qualities to enjoy a very successful career with Vodafone.Kind regards Kevin Mills",,,2025-06-05T16:52:09.000Z

Rated,"I was a customer of BT‚Äôs full fibre service for two years, and switched to Vodafone only because of a cheaper offer ‚Äî and I deeply regret it! Their internet service is completely unreliable. Every time I struggle to get in touch ‚Äî due to Vodafone‚Äôs outdated and frustrating communication system ‚Äî I‚Äôm met with generic, meaningless responses. Their support team clearly lacks a basic understanding of simple networking concepts.Vodafone‚Äôs full fibre setup has fundamental issues, and the speeds they advertise simply don‚Äôt exist in practiceI am a professional Video Editor and always need to send a receiving large video files. This service is not even enough for checking your email",,,2025-06-05T07:24:59.000Z
Rated,"After a formal complaint and a lengthy back-and-forth, Vodafone finally agreed to reduce my airtime from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11 a month and credited my account with ¬£50 ‚Äî supposedly covering two months. I thought the issue was resolved.Then suddenly, on 4 June, Vodafone took three separate payments from my account:‚Ä¢ ¬£25.46 (airtime ‚Äî which was supposed to be reduced!)‚Ä¢ ¬£10.00 (device)‚Ä¢ ¬£12.00 (device)I‚Äôm not disputing the device charges ‚Äî but the ¬£25.46 goes directly against what was agreed. Once again, I‚Äôm left chasing Vodafone for money I didn‚Äôt consent to pay, after being told this was sorted.This situation has added unnecessary financial pressure and stress, especially when I‚Äôve done everything Vodafone asked and acted in good faith. I‚Äôve now had to escalate again and CC the CEO. Why should I keep dealing with mistakes that Vodafone promised were resolved?This is unacceptable, and I hope this public review helps push for accountability ‚Äî again.After reaching a formal agreement with Vodafone (Ref: 138249138), I was told my airtime bill would drop from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11/month and that I had been credited ¬£50 to cover the next two months. I was finally starting to feel some relief after all the stress I‚Äôd already gone through.But despite this agreement, Vodafone took the full ¬£25.46 airtime payment again on 4 June ‚Äî on top of the ¬£10 and ¬£12 device plan payments. I never disputed the device charges, but the airtime charge should NOT have been taken.This isn't just a technical error ‚Äî it‚Äôs had a real and serious impact on me. I am already in a financial crisis, and this unnecessary charge has made things worse. I feel crippled by stress from having to deal with Vodafone over and over, especially after the rude and dismissive treatment I received from one of their representatives. That experience alone left a lasting emotional impact I still haven‚Äôt been able to move past.To feel some hope through a resolution, only to have it undone without explanation, has made things worse than before. This isn‚Äôt just poor service ‚Äî it‚Äôs neglectful and harmful.I've now had to escalate this again and CC Vodafone's CEO, Max Taylor, in my latest complaint. I‚Äôm also prepared to go to CISAS if this is not resolved swiftly and fairly. Enough is enough.",,,2025-06-05T15:54:34.000Z
Rated,Unfortunately can‚Äôt give zero stars. Vodafone make it as difficult as possible if want to change your contract or buy a sim only vodafone deal from carphone warehouse which they call a 3rd party provider. They want you to do a vodafone upgrade which essentially gives them more money (around ¬£100 more over contract term) and despite a couple of the staff on retention team stating you can do it with a post to post migration they continue to be as awkward as possible and simply want to make more sales. Spent hours on their utterly useless live chat presumably from India where their was a complete lack of communication. Unable to resolve any issues which aren‚Äôt straightforward. Telephoned retentions and on hold for 30 mins only to have the most useless member of staff Mohammad who stated I need to upgrade and have to get a pay as you go sim and transfer after 30 days. Called back next day to be told something completely different and don‚Äôt need to do that. Ended up doing an upgrade as loosing the will to live with them and just wanted it sorted. Definitely changing provider next time.,,,2025-06-05T03:30:54.000Z

Rated,Pathetic service. The app was down on 3/6/25. I wasn‚Äôt aware at the time and called 191 at 3.27pm and spoke to the most incompetent call handler i have ever dealt with. He told me that Vodafone was no longer allowing top ups for any one on the app and that I would have to buy a voucher from a shop. I found this really odd and even asked for a PAC code to move providers . Luckily I didn‚Äôt listen to him and waited instead and the app issue replaced itself.

Rated,"I upgraded my device with the option to trade in - this was for the value of ¬£400.I was under the assumption that the ¬£400 credit would be applied to my account and I would pay my bill as usual. Vodafone received my device and confirmed the ¬£400 credit with a green banner within the MyVodafone app that stated ""You have ¬£400 account credit"".When it came to paying my bill, I received a notification that my Direct Debit would be ¬£400 higher this month. I called Vodafone and they advised that the credit could not be applied to my current bill, but I could use it on the next one. Meaning I would be ¬£400 down for a month. I am not really in a position to be able to do this, which is why I traded in the old device. I called Vodafone and asked if this could be refunded to my bank account if I made the payment - I was advised it could be. I hesitated paying this, as it would (and now has) put me in a difficult financial situation - I cannot be without broadband and mobile as I work from home, so today I paid the bill.I called Vodafone to ask about this credit being returned to me, and honestly feel like my intelligence is being questioned.. The agent I spoke to (Loretta) was very helpful, but told me initially that it owuldn't be possible to have the credit paid out to me as ""it is still accruing in the account, and is currently only at ¬£393.."" this makes absolutely no sense. Loretta went away to speak to some other team and came back and said that it would not be possible as that credit has not been ""allocated"".. even though I can see in a big green box that I have ¬£400 credit. I then asked Loretta if I could then just have the ¬£393, if that is what has ""accrued"". She went away again to speak to another team for quite a while and then came back to tell me this is not possible and I would have to wait until the next billing cycle. I then asked Loretta if she could confirm that that account credit would still be available when my next bill is issued, rather than being used to pay the bill and she said ""No, we will deduct the billed amount before sending the funds""I really feel like my intelligence is being insulted.. the account credit is there, it is not ""accruing"" - the device I traded in was a whole device, I didn't send it piece by piece so it makes no sense that the credit would ""accrue"". I understand that companies want to do as much as they can to not have to transfer funds out, but I was told that this was possible, without any caveats about the credit needing to accrue, or be allocated (it clearly has been allocated as I can see available credit within my app to be used!Please either arrange for a refund or return my device. I am now out of pocket due to a very poorly executed trade-in process and a billing team that clearly just want to try to avoid making any payouts.",,,2025-06-04T17:22:22.000Z

Rated,"10 weeks from planned activation date, Openreach finally finished the incomplete work to install our Full Fibre connection! Vodafone then instruct our current provider to disconnect us and leave us with no Internet connection at all!It's a very long story:Ordered our Vodafone full fibre on 7th JanChoose 1st available Openreach appointment - March 21st.  Prior to this, Openreach contractors dug up the path at the end of our driveway, not very neatly21st March arrives and Openreach engineer tells us he cannot fit the cable to the house becausethe initial ground works were not completed correctly. No rope to pull cable through conduit, ground junction box is filled with tarmac, no connection box installed on wall.2nd engineer apt is made for March 28th - still unable to complete as apparently there is a blockage!I chat every week to Vodafone who blame the issue on Opereach and every week say there is a blockage that requires a specialist engineer - the issue is with the chief engineer who has a heavy workload!On 17th may Vodafone say Openreach promise the work will be done by 23rd May which as predicted does not happen!23rd May - Vodafone agent has the sense to tell me they are raising an official escalation with Openreach. Unsure why this hasn't been done by any other of the agents until so far down the line!2nd June - Openreach engineer calls me and says will arrive in 20mins. Finishes the connection within half hour and says it is up and running. He doesn't know what the blockage or issue is meant to be as he has no problem running the cable inside or connecting the router so who knows what we have been waiting for over the last 10 weeks!Shortly after he leaves, Vodafone instruct my provider to disconnect but the new Vodafone connection doesn't start working!That afternoon, I spend 1hr speaking to tech support going through troubleshooting and they finally tell me they will send a new router as firmware out of date.3rd June - I chat online to ask for confirmation the router will arrive today. Tech support now tell me that there is nothing wrong with the router as it is a new Power Hub!Whilst another agent is trying to find out what the issue is, I get disconnected from my mobile data as a result of trying to connect to WiFi as asked.  I then reconnect to yet another agent!I reconnect to another agent and speak to him for an hour, switching, unplugging, resetting, updating etc then get disconnected again as I am relying on mobile data!I rejoin the queue and chat to agent no 3, really loosing hope now! They then say they will pass me to the activations team as my order is still in open status! They have obviously admitted defeat! I asked to speak to a manager but apparently I have to speak to an activations team member first! Speak to this team member who asks me yet again to reset the router and updates something their end! Of course it doesn't make any difference and they transfer me to a manager. Turns out yesterday's promised router won't arrive until tomorrow but they place yet another order to send a 2nd one out today! They have gone back to believing the router needs replacing because of the firmware which strangely can't be done remotely. Speak to shift mgr who just repeats what I have already been told.  End my chat at 4hrs!4th June - Amazingly, the new router arrives and actually connects to the new network! I'm hoping this is the last time I need to chat to Vodafone but am not optimistic! Since January we have been paying ¬£14 more per mth to our existing provider as we are out of contract! The max compensation Vodafone will pay is ¬£374.40 (¬£6.24 x 60 days) This is the only reason we haven't cancelled. We also have 2 Vodafone mobile contracts in the household but although the internet is up and running now, I will not be choosing Vodafone for anything again in the future, due to how this was handled. I have been told today, the compensation won't be applied to my account until August. The least they could do is apply it to the 1st bill",,,2025-06-04T16:17:47.000Z

I never cared much for the latest phone but needed roaming, minutes and texts as well as some data. Due to my job, I received 20% off the bill and still paid about ¬£28 per month. This doesn't appear a lot compared to some people who pay ¬£50-¬£60 with a phone included but overall, they have always been responsive and helpful. The network is hit and miss at times but I can't fault them for having been a good company but unfortunately your rates don't compare to other companies these days, who offer similar Sim only deals for half the price. Now I pay ¬£7 per month with no price rises, roaming included, unlimited texts and minutes and 30GB data per month, which rolls over, so ideal for me.",,,2025-06-04T15:18:57.000Z

Rated,"I have been a Vodafone broadband customer for since last 3 years; I started facing issues 1 year later. I am out of my Vodafone contract since October 2025. Now I left my old rented home on May 19, 2025 .When I requested for a disconnection with Vodafone on 25 April 2025 they told they could only disconnect on 26th May 2025. So I agreed, and they raised the disconnection request. I got a confirmation email and a sorry to see u go email on the same day from Vodafone. Then After 3 weeks, on May 14, they took the bill for June and send another confirmation email saying i am disconnecting services on 27th of June. When I approached the Vodafone support, they didn't have any clue they escalated to 3 different teams, wasted 3 hours in chat and later they told I wouldn't be able to disconnect because the new tenant raised an connection request with another vendor, and hence I need to continue to pay the bill until they find the issue. So I removed my debit last week, as I am not using the internet, and moved out of the rented house on 19th MAY. although  I already lost the payment taken for June month .The reason is so silly; I don't know how a reputed company can behave in a stupid way.  After all these conversations, the customer care team is asking me to take a mobile data plan which looks like they are least bothered about their customer concerns rather than selling their product. Now I can see a couple of bills have been generated till July 2025 hope they will continue for an infinite number of day even though they don't have any connection. I am not sure what to do. Do I need to go to consumer court or complain about this to Ofcom? Anyone, please advice .",,,2025-06-04T14:20:18.000Z

Whoever I spoke to at Vodafone would not let me speak to the Installations Team, they spoke to them and parroted back the date I was given, NOT bothering to contact Openreach. Vodafone think that more digging needs to be done, I can see the roll of cable already in my porch.  I signed up on April 9th, was given an installation date of May 6th. A problem with the conduit meant that I went into the 3-week wait till next visit by the civils team - great people and they seemed to fix it, just that Vodafone don't seem to have bothered to update anything - ""fob him off, we don't want to chase anything"" seems to be the team motto. I can't decide whether to ditch the lot or persevere as they are alleged to have a better signal, and I guess that's what they depend on, never mind customer service.

I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life and which you wouldn't get from 02 or EE.

Rated,"Today, while on my way to do my grocery shopping, I came across a distressed woman‚Äîshe was homeless and had special needs. She couldn‚Äôt top up her phone and didn‚Äôt understand why. I checked the phone for her: the device was working fine and could dial out, but none of the top-up service numbers were functioning.After a quick search, I saw a surge in complaints about Vodafone outages. It looked like whatever issue was affecting your systems had also taken out the top-up service.This woman was already going through a lot‚Äîher husband had recently passed away, and she was trying to sort out essential things like medical appointments and other urgent support. Being cut off from her only means of communication was the last thing she needed.I contacted Vodafone support using my own phone and waited 30 minutes before being transferred to the top-up line. The person I spoke to gave me a number, then immediately tried to end the call. I stopped her‚Äîafter waiting that long, I wasn‚Äôt going to be left without answers. But the number didn‚Äôt work. Neither of the two numbers she gave me worked.In the end, I used my own debit card to top up the woman‚Äôs phone, because there was no working way to do it otherwise.Please investigate this. Your system failure left a vulnerable person cut off and unsupported, and that‚Äôs not just a technical issue‚Äîit has real human consequences.",,,2025-06-02T23:14:33.000Z

Rated,"My husband and I decided  to switch to Vodafone for our broadband supplier and booked for installation on 22/5/25It‚Äôs now 2/6/25 and we have had no live broadband service as yet from them following this installation.Now spent a total of approx 4 hours on webchat with them (using mobile data as hey we don‚Äôt have broadband ü§î thanks to Vodafone.) also spent about an hour on telephone with them - still no further forward.  Missed the champions league final on tv, can‚Äôt stream tv, can‚Äôt work from home or check emails and no end in sight currently.  Running through data on phone to stay online as no other alternative.Had a communication from Vodafone on 23/5/25 apologising that broadband not working yet but not to do anything and they would sort it.  Waited 7 days and then we got in touch with them - if we hadn‚Äôt I am sure we would still be waiting on an update from them. I appreciate there are teething problems sometimes with a new service but the fact there has been no resolution and we are still waiting is not good enough.A communications company that can‚Äôt communicate with its customers doesn‚Äôt fill you with confidence - the fact that they can‚Äôt even guarantee connection on the webchat facility without you pressing a . every 60 seconds doesn‚Äôt again inspire confidence and competence with them.Wish we had stayed with our old supplier now",,,2025-06-02T18:18:35.000Z

The service is run to minimise costs so ask the bot to speak to a person and it asks irrelevant questions.When you do speak to a person their scripts are too long winded and involve waiting while their machines process thingsIn the end they would not deliver the equipment without me attending a shop.

Rated,I ordered fibre broadband from Vodafone on 29/11/2024. It is now June 2025 and I am still not connected. Their complaints service is next to useless - you communicate with a customer service centre that has no idea what is going on and no idea how to resolve problems. They ignore specific questions and request for escalation. They say it's not their fault or Openreach's fault but because civils are required to bring the line from the other side of the street so surveys are required by Openreach. In fact Openreach have 3 times sent people to carry out a survey and come up with a solution for connection. $ times Openreach have sent people to connect my home to the line that they haven't put in yet.Vodafone seem to have no basic service level agreement with Openreach or are not enforcing it. On the positive side they have sent me two broadband routers!,,,2025-06-02T13:26:29.000Z

Reconnection cancelled by Vodafone with no notice whatsoever; had to call to find out it had been cancelled. All records again incorrect having apparently been corrected when reconnection booked. Woeful. Avoid!,,,2025-06-02T12:10:34.000Z
Rated,"Contacted for an up to date delivery date for broadband router. For most companies this requires confirmation of a few details e.g. order number, post code, etc. and admittedly I should have been more prepared with details to hand. However, for Vodafone you have to even recall the last contact you had with them and whether this was over chat, email or phone. The whole process must have taken around 30 minutes. Had to wait a long time between responses from Vodafone customer service agent and was given many non-responses and time fillers e.g. ""I am checking the details"" which likely meant ""I am helping another customer"". Every time my connection dropped slightly I received a  reply saying they had not heard from me in quite some time despite me having to wait a long time between their responses. Let's just hope the broadband is better than their customer service so I don't have to contact them again.  Would not recommend using the chat service at all if possible and next time I will phone but for people who rely on chat for accessibility reasons this would not be possible. I think I've unfortunately passed the 14 day cooling off period as my soonest activation date and delivery date were a long time from my order date otherwise I would probably be cancelling my order and going with another provider.",,,2025-06-02T12:08:23.000Z

However then my issues started, on switch day the new router didn't work and they turned the previous supplier off so left me without the internet for a work day (and I work from home) They had to post a new router out which needed to be signed for, however they did not understand that being in to sign for this when I had to do 5 hour round trip to the office to be able to work, was not understood. Just over 2 weeks later, no internet on Saturday but then came back and started working this morning ok and now it's gone again - they need to send an Openreach engineer, coming tomorrow - no internet again and over an hour on the phone to them, absolutely awful service and wishing I'd never switched to them, customer service is appalling!",,,2025-06-02T11:18:03.000Z

Rated,"I contacted Vodafone after closing my bank account and asked them to cancel the direct debit as the account no longer exists. They refused. I tried again a few days later and explained as if I was talking to a child that it would cause problems with my payment if the direct debit is attempted.They again refused to cancel the direct debit. This went on for multiple phone calls and multiple complaints.The direct debit was taken out of the closed bank account indicating the payment was made. I made a manual payment.The direct debit was then returned to the bank in question. The next day I get a text and email saying my bill is unpaid. Now they are saying I haven't made my bill payment and I have to pay them again. If I don't my account will be restricted and I'll receive late payment fees.So, I explain the bank account in question is closed. I explain that the direct debit will fail and cause me to have a late payment or it'll cause problems with the manual payment. Yet they knowingly refuse to act accordingly putting my finances, and communications at risk. The company hasn't changed in 15 years. Still thieves and liars.I would strongly recommend anyone considering joining Vodafone looks for a different communication provider. Vodafone will destroy your credit score, they will destroy your mental health, they will destroy your life. And they will make you pay for the privilege.Got a text at 6.45 This morning saying I'd get a callback between 12 and 2 today. It goes past 2pm and I call to find out what happened. Only to be told the agent who text me isn't at work today. The whole company is absolutely useless. Full of liars and thieves.I've wasted all the time I'm prepared. If my problem isn't fixed today I'll close my accounts. I'm not dealing with thieves and liars",,,2025-05-31T13:35:35.000Z

After 48 hours I contacted them again as I still hadn‚Äôt received any communication and I was told the phone was ‚Äòstuck‚Äô at the warehouse but that they ‚Äòguarantee‚Äô I‚Äôll hear from them within 7 days‚Ä¶ contacted them again 8 days later as I still hadn‚Äôt received any contact at all from them and was told the order had to be cancelled because the warehouse didn‚Äôt receive the signed plan - the same signed plan I was sent via email on the day I ordered. Even when I offered to send them the signed document they had sent me with the time stamp of the day of purchase they couldn‚Äôt accept. Clearly some issues with their warehouse and sales/website not communicating and a complete void of any customer service as not once have I been contacted to apologise for the inconvenience of not receiving my order or having to contact them to find out what‚Äôs happening rather than the other way around.

Rated,"I‚Äôm one of those people that chop and change broadband providers to get a good deal so I went with Vodafone despite reading bad reviews, thinking ‚Äò they‚Äôre a big company I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine‚Äô.I was wrong.Customer service is terrible, impossible to get hold of ( one time over an hour and a half on hold and still no answer). Total incompetence from staff as well, one will say one thing and you‚Äôll get past around from one department to another and the next person will contradict the previous person on what is causing an issue ect. I spent over 3 hours one night trying to get our internet working after activation after a house move and it was painful tbh. I got nowhere and in the end I gave up. I tried again the next night on their Tobi online chat and this time I was hit with different reasons as to why it was still not working. Again no connection. At this point I went on my sky app to go back with them as I‚Äôd had enough, so then tried to leave Vodafone which was also ridiculously impossible. Was I at the beginning of a contact as I‚Äôd just moved or was I still on monthly rolling as I‚Äôd been with them nearly two years? Again I was getting mixed messages from Vodafone with one person saying one thing and the next one saying the opposite. It was almost like a wind up the service was so bad.I was also told  that the 3 weeks I wasn‚Äôt receiving any service after moving house that I would not be getting changed, but guess what? They did charge me the full amount!In the end, in their compete and utter uselessness they mucked up in my favour as on the third consecutive night of phoning them I actually spoke to a ‚ÄòSamantha‚Äô who tbh was the only decent staff member I dealt with. While on the phone basically pleading with her to just cancel my service so I could go elsewhere she mentioned I took out my contract with them  STARTING IN DECEMBER 2025 when we were still in MAY 2025! I told her to repeat what she just said and as she was doing so stopped mid sentence and realised the total ball‚Äôs up in apparently starting a contract in the future. This was my get out as the contract was null and void and she agreed to cancel my contract immediately! Phew!! Samantha admitted she had no idea how that had happened, and it was for me at least my get out from the worst service by a country mile I‚Äôve ever encountered from any company regardless of size let alone a big one like Vodafone.TLTR. Don‚Äôt be like me and ignore the negative reviews like I did, thinking you‚Äôll be ok. You won‚Äôt.",,,2025-05-29T21:05:59.000Z

They then have the cheek to offer you booster boxes which would increase your bill and if you want to cancel its over ¬£100 so your basically trapped with rubbish internet. Dont get me started on customer service, yes you will always get through to someone after waiting but they never offer you a solution and talk to you like your a child after jumping through hoop after hoop before you even get to speak about your issue.",,,2025-05-29T20:25:18.000Z
Rated,"Back in January I spoke to Vodafone as I had changed jobs and my pay day meant I would have to change my payment date to 1st of each month, they confirmed it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and due to billing cycle wouldn‚Äôt take affect until March. Spoke to Vodafone today as my direct debit was meant to be taken on 1st of each month, explained they took the bill early which has meant I have gone overdrawn (pay day is tomorrow) Spent two long hours on the phone and I was told it was mistake their end but it‚Äôs impossible to move billing cycle so I should have never been told the 1st is ok. By way of recompense they offered ¬£5 Morrisons voucher. I explained this should never have happened and the overdraft fee alone would be more than this paltry amount. The lady disappeared and offered a ¬£10 e voucher on her return. Each time she said that it was the best she could do. Clearly both were lies! So even though it‚Äôs Vodafone mess up nothing was offered as fair compensation. Luckily I‚Äôm out of fixed contracts with Vodafone and have moved all my accounts elsewhere which is a shame as I had been with them for the better part of 18 years. After numerous mess ups over the years this was the final straw. They did offer to match what I had found but still couldn‚Äôt move my direct debit to the 1st of each mont, had they been able to do that I would have been tempted to stay. After testing my wired/wifi connection also turns out I‚Äôm getting less than their minimum guaranteed! (I have gigafast package) Also the lack of 5g in my area is also annoying.

You then try to talk to an actual human and very conveniently the website will freeze and none of the buttons will do anything.

Surprisingly, no one at Vodafone could fix my name in my account. The only option was for me to submit a name change request which required the account number which I still didn't have since it was not activated yet. So basically I got locked out and no one could sort it out at Vodafone and the only option (less stressful) was to let the order expire and be canceled.Hopefully, I went to Vodafone Covent Garden to re-order it where I was assisted by Huseyin and Qasim who went above and beyond to ensure I had my plan placed and internet activated.

I can't stream without there being some kind of connection issues.nive spoken to multiple agents at the company all of which have no idea what they're doing! The last agent I spoke to transferred me to about 3 or 4 different people and I ended up with someone trying to sign me up as a new customer!!! Absolute shambles! Any review telling you Vodafone is the best overall provider must be lying. If I was you, I'd avoid at all costs.

Rated,"This has been a terrible experience with Vodafone. I needed to move home while still under contract with them. I called more than two weeks before my moving date to arrange broadband activation at my new address. The customer service representative assured me that someone would come to install and activate the broadband on the scheduled day.However, no one showed up, and I received no communication or updates. I then called customer service and spent over an hour on the phone. The representative promised that her manager would call me back within 24 to 48 hours ‚Äî but, once again, no one followed through.After five days without internet and no updates, I called again. This time, someone based in the UK informed me that the installation had been rescheduled for more than a week later. I requested compensation, as I would be without internet for almost half a month while still being charged the full monthly fee. The customer service agent, however, made every excuse to avoid offering any compensation.It was only after I mentioned reporting the issue to Ofcom that the agent finally took the matter seriously and said she would check for an earlier installation date. The new date is now six days away, but I have still received no compensation for being without internet for over 10 days ‚Äî not to mention the stress and frustration of dealing with their customer service.This has been a dreadful experience. I used to live in the U.S., and people often complained about AT&T ‚Äî a provider I used for many years. But compared to Vodafone, AT&T feels like an angel.

Rated,"My Internet didn't work for 3 months, going through vodafone phone system to try and resolve the issue is unbearable, everytime on hold for at least 45min before anyone picks up only to be transferred from department to department. Every question I asked involves me being put on hold for 20min wile they have to ask someone else for an answer. Everything I told them about the Internet not working involves them having to tell someone else and again being put on hold for another 20min. OUTRAGEOUS!!!Once the problem was raised they send me a txt message in the evening saying the problem had been resolved when it haven't. So the next day I had to do it all again, for 3 months. The total time I was on the phone to them was well over 40hours. OUTRAGEOUS!!! I have been through terrible phone systems before from other companies but nothing even comes close to how bad vodafone are. During the 3 months my Internet didn't work they never forgot to charge me. Eventually after 3 months they got my Internet working, I asked them about getting a refund, they said I get a refund for the period of time my Internet was down but it won't be applied to my account for 2 months, 3 months later I was still being charged, I rang them again to ask why? Another 45min just to get through to someone, everything I asked involves me being put on hold for 15min to get an answer, eventually they said I was owed a refund and can I stay on hold wile they calculated it, it took over an hour to work out apparently because my Internet was down for so long only for them to say I'm not getting any refund. I asked why? Another 15min on hold to be told because I missed 1 call from them (because I was at work and couldn't pick up my phone) that is enough of a reason for them to say I delayed the process. I asked when was this call? Another 20min on hold to be told it was 2 months into my Internet being down. So no refund even for the 2 months before this apparently phone call, OUTRAGEOUS!!! And that's all they need to deny you any refund at all for not providing a service there charging you for.If you speak to vodafone wanting to take out a contract you go through to an English call centre, if you have a problem you go though to an Indian call centre, where the hold times are insane OUTRAGIOUS!!! Like I said total time I was on the phone to vodafone was over 40 hours and probably more like 60hours. I've never known anything like it.",,,2025-05-26T17:00:26.000Z

Rated,"Location: Cambridgelets start about a year ago, and everywhere I went around Cambridge and the surrounding areas I was struggling to get a signal on vodafone. I called and they ran me through the usual of getting the most up to date carrier settings for my phone (this was repeated many times I called vodafone), but this did not fix the issue. The phone was not the issue as I bought a Pixel 9 and experienced the same issue.I had a strong signal (full 4G) but I could not get and bandwidth and it became so bad that at around 4-6pm, if I wanted to make a call, I would have to disable 4G to actually make a call.I reported all this to vodafone, but nobody on the team could understand the difference between signal and bandwidth.Fast forward to just recently, and I called asking to cancel my contract, at first they tried to run me through troubleshooting, then asking what I had been offered in other places, and after 20 minutes of me refusing to answer their questions and just asking to cancel my contract, they put the phone down.I called again very angry and luckily had somebody that just processed the cancellation with no questions, however it took over 30 minutes to do this.Not had any issues on EE yet, but I will not be touching Vodafone againEdit: I'm gone, you can't get me back.

Rated,"Excellent, so good and honest. The best experience I've had in mobile phone shop.Update: I was told phone number would change over by 4pm Tuesday. Still not changed by this evening Wednesday. Phoned the customer service and was told the request had not been actioned. So they had to do this today so will not be able to use phone until Fri/ Sat. A full week after purchase so told customer advisor that I was paying under 2 contracts due to their error, told to take it up with the shop as it was my word and I cannot prove it as they have no record! üò° So basically called a liar. Then thought maybe I should double check the package I've been sold. Went onto my vodaphone could not access, they asked for a password. Never had one so. Tried to set up a new account for it to stare I already had one. So clicked on forgot password. Came up that an email has been sent to my email but the email address doesn't exist or if it does, does not belong to me which is worrying that my data could be breached. So I phone again to be told they cannot amend my email address. I now have to go back to the shop on Saturday to sort it. Absolutely fuming!! üò°üò°",,,2025-05-28T20:19:13.000Z

We have been experiencing problems with them for a while and my partner just switched to another company with a PAYG SIM to escape them. We could not use their app, or even get the money they kept taking from us translated into phone credit. We have still not been able to get them to close the account, and they continue to take money. We have had to close our Bank Account to stop them taking money. It is causing other problems now because the new bank account with another company is not yet up and running.In short, Vodafone are a bunch of clowns!

Rated,"I made a decision to switch from current BB provider to Vodafone after reading reviews. Ordered the home BB service on 9th May 2025 via Uswitch link as they were offering a ¬£90 gift card reward.Received email confirmation and chose installation date as Thursday 29th May. Email stated that equipment would arrive 3 working days before installation date which I realised would be a bank holiday Monday.I called up to enquire about the installation only to be informed that the order had been cancelled without any explanation. First customer service staff member blamed uSwitch and said they had cancelled.I emailed uSwitch and they responded promptly saying they did not store any information on their systems as all information and order would have been processed and credit checks done through the Vodafone website.I called customer service again. This time it was a lady on the phone who checked account again and informed me that the order had been cancelled and the account was credit check pending. Lady offered to reorder which I declined as that meant I would lose out on the ¬£90 cash back offer from uSwitch.Within the last two weeks there was no communication via email or phone to inform me of the status of my order. I only learnt of the outcome when I phoned up.And now seeing there are 30% complaints with customers leaving 1 start reviews, I am contemplating of remaining with my current home BB provider.",,,2025-05-23T20:00:55.000Z

Rated,"Vodafone has delivered, without a doubt, the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever encountered. I‚Äôve been a customer for over six months, and during this time, I‚Äôve been completely unable to access my account. This has prevented me from resetting up a direct debit, which has led to overcharge and unjustified late fees.I‚Äôve spent more than four hours on the phone with their support team, being bounced around between departments, only to be told time and again that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do.‚Äù Not only have they failed to fix the issue, they refuse to take responsibility or even remove the fees caused by their own broken systems. They also refuse to transfer me to their managers. The only thing vodafone proposes to its clients is to pay more, for an unexistant service.The level of incompetence and indifference is staggering. Vodafone clearly has no interest in helping their customers, resolving issues, or even providing basic functionality. It‚Äôs astonishing that a major telecom company can operate with such a blatant disregard for its customers.I will be filing a formal complaint with the Communication & Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS). If you‚Äôre considering Vodafone‚Äîdon‚Äôt. Spare yourself the stress and look elsewhere.Edit: the late fee has been cancelled after 2h30 on the phone. But I am still not able to connect to my account.",,,2025-05-23T13:33:11.000Z

Rated,"I recently joined Vodafone but am beginning to regret this decision. I changed bank current accounts which resulted in a direct debit for Vodafone not being transferred over. As soon as they alerted me to this fact I set up anew one the same day. Despite this I was charged a fee by Vodafone for payment being less than a week late. I tried to query Vodafone‚Äôs eagerness to charge a fee but I found to my cost that their customer service is woeful. There is no way to email Vodafone, instead you are directed to a totally inept web chat that I assume is manned by poorly trained call centre staff working from a script. Vodafone appear to copying Amazon‚Äôs lead by making it difficult to lodge a formal complaint in the hope that people will just give up. I have emailed Vodafone‚Äôs CEO to pass on my complaint but it seems that he too is not interested in dealing with adverse customer feedback. As yet I‚Äôve had no reply.I would advise anyone to avoid Vodafone and will be changing provider as soon as my contract is up.I‚Äôm sure that I will get a generic response from Vodafone directing me to a Facebook page if I wish to discuss the matter further.

Loyalty does not pay I would urge all VF customers to check Uswitch for a fairer deal.UpdateCalled back on the number provided by Social media team. VF rep was nice but useless still the same deal offered so loyalty does not pay. Tried to put us off using an MVNO as it wasn't premium. Then told her of a Uswitch offer with Three . She then proceeded to tell us they weren't that good.......very strange we told her as VF and Three are to merge shortly. After stumbling around a bit we thanked her and the call ended.

I had to speak with someone in vodafone customer service as the old device was never removed as promised therefore I was still charged. I paid to finish that contract on the day which vodafone I did not do and I am now still being asked to pay out of the contract which has already been done. I was charged ¬£140 today and threatened to be reported to credit agencies. It is 13:28pm in the Afternoon, I have been on the phone since 10am spoke with numerous agents who have no idea how to handle my complaint and have now been cut off at least 3 times. I have phoned repeatedly today and would prefer that someone takes ownership of this issue and calls me back to finally resolve it.

Rated,Update on Vodafone service. Having waited since January 23 to activate broadband and telephone to the home of a severely disabled elderly lady I can report that the router has been installed in a location that conflicts with published instruction issued by Vodafone. Unable to connect her devices the help of the Vodafone  Bridgwater shop said ‚ÄúVodafone operatives aren‚Äôt insured to enter customers homes‚Äù. As I‚Äôm advised that subcontractors conduct Vodafone installations it surely follows that they too aren‚Äôt insured. Should you have challenging health condition do NOT rely on this company for assistance as you will be disappointed. How then when requested to assist disabled people who need assistance connecting devices do they serve all customers if they aren‚Äôt insured to enter your home? It appears that Vodafone is just a name and all actual work is conducted using subcontractors. Forget this company if you need any assistance due to personal circumstances and or assistance as they aren‚Äôt interested.,,,2025-05-21T19:42:19.000Z

Rated,Getting through to Vodafone is a real pain. it has taken 1 1/2 hours to sort out how to get signed on to my account. Half spent dealing with a useless chat bot and two with a human who couldn't help. When I signed in it sent an SMS to my landline with a signon code which said 'zero minutes'. It turns out they cannot send SMS to a landline so why did they allow me to attach my landline in the first place! The chatbot was useless and the human wasn't much help. after 30 minutes they told me I failed security so had to go to a store. Another wait and it took 20 minutes to get it sorted. Vodafone is another robotic company when if your query doesn't fit with their program you get no where. If I could have e-mailed them I would not have had to hang on.,,,2025-05-21T19:04:34.000Z

No. Live chat is completely worthless, takes nearly an hour to get something done every time. As soon as my contract is over, I will be going elsewhere and with my WIFI. The customer service is an absolute joke at this company and they do not care. I have never spoken to someone who hasn‚Äôt got a bad attitude, or who hasn‚Äôt argued back with me.

When my number and contract were finally set up I was automatically subscribed to lots of extra add ons which I had to manually cancel but I find this a bit sleazy as it could easily be missed and recurring charges would be made.

I used the online chat service to ask why it wasn‚Äôt finished, but none of the agents could resolve the issue. They suggested I call another number, but I didn‚Äôt have time. The last agent then rescheduled another porting request for tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt think that will happen either. This is my second time trying to port my number in the UK, and both times have been disasters.

I explained that the bill was due on 21st May so why were they even badgering me but agent said no its due the 20th, i have bill saying 21st and text saying 21st but then asked to send them the proof the agent even tried to sell me something when i am trying to solve the issue, ended up ending the call because they were not interested in solving the issue.

Rated,"FTTP Broadband from Vodafone:I've just had a truly dreadful experience with Vodafone and thought I would warn others.My 1.6Gbps FTTP service was installed yesterday at the second attempt (8 days after it should have been). The service worked at the advertised speeds getting 1.6Gbps during the day and being throttled to their 'guaranteed minimum' 800Mbps later in the evening and through midnight and beyond.The issue is that the supplied Ultra Hub only has 1 x 2.5Gbps port (which is used for the ONT incoming fibre connection) and 4 x 1Gbps ports which obviously can't supply the 1.6Gbps I paid for to my wired 10Gbps intranet and BE85 WiFi7 mesh system.As I'm only on day 2 of the 'cooling off period' I tried to get Vodafone to simply swap the Router for the one they now include in the exact same 1.6Gbps package. Should have been easy, Right? Wrong! Chat to AI bot and then Agent last night got me nothing except 'call a number tomorrow'. I did. The first agent at least tried to be helpful but couldn't do what was needed. The second agent in termination/retentions frankly couldn't give a damn so I simply terminated the contract.I've now ordered a 1.6Gbps service from EE (who also guarantee a minimum 1.3Gbps which is much better than Vodafone's 800 minimum!).I only need a Hub that works and feeds into my existing intranet so customer service should not be needed (I've heard that EE aren't great either).I would now have to suggest very strongly that people avoid Vodafone based on my experience (as a pre-existing broadband user). I didn't have any problems with them before, but they failed me with what should have been a very simple replacement task.Obviously this speed issue only applies to plans above 1 Gbps, but I would also add that it was impossible to get the supplied WiFi Extender to pair, and I'm a computer geek having worked in the industry all my life. The pairing issue is apparently very common. Caveat Emptor!Edit: I reached out to Vodafone via Facebook messaging as requested in their response, went through the exact same process I'd previously already gone through 3 times today, and eventually got told to phone another landline number for an IMMEDIATE disconnect! I had requested Saturday midnight. Talk about adding insult to injury. I can only think they are trying to force me beyond the 14 day no cancellation fee deadline.Please note right here that I tried to cancel this 4 times today May 20th 2025 and I expect that request to be honored and no early termination fee charged!I was also unable to raise a formal complaint, but told the details for that were on their website!",,,2025-05-20T17:21:05.000Z

She obviously had a complete understanding of company procedure in respect of broadband and ancillary matters and what she was unable to resolve my problem immediately she was able to recommend a future route to resolve matters.

Rated,"I have been without broadband for approaching 3 months. It‚Äôs an issue that had the multiple advisors I‚Äôve contacted actually listened, would have been fixed in 2 weeks at worst.As it stands after Openreach (who have been excellent) repaired the cable that had been cut during gas pipe replacement in my area, and leaving me just needing to have the cable reconnecting to my property. I have been unable to get Vodafone to arrange for this to happen. Because they have kept charging me! You get about ¬£9 a day compensation, so I am actually in credit by over ¬£500 currently. And today, yet again, I have been unable to get the engineer visit booked. Avoid VODAFONE BROADBAND AT ALL COSTS.",,,2025-05-19T21:02:56.000Z

Rated,"Vodafone's reputation in my area of Cardiff is rock bottom, almost all of that is due to their fitters, who will under no circumstances whatsoever, put the hardware, cables, boxes etc. anywhere but the most fast and convenient place for them to fit.Spoke to Vodafone, most apologetic, definitely get that changed for you madam, let me just transfer you to the fitters you just complained about.  That went as well as you can imagine.Upshot is when I move in the next few months, I will make it clear that the new occupant should choose Virgin or BT, cheap is cheap for a reason.Per the response, I gave you a rare second chance, I never give a third.",,,2025-05-19T18:48:31.000Z

Rated,"Zero is not available unfortunately. I have never had such a shockingly bad customer experience. I transferred my service to Vodafone broadband from Virgin Media in April. When it transferred I contacted Virgin to enquire about returning my equipment and was told my service hadn't been cancelled with them by Vodafone. Vodafone initially claimed that they couldn't tell Virgin even though they can tell other providers. Virgin claim this is totally incorrect. They blamed one another at this point. I spent many hours on phone and chat with both companies dealing with this and eventually was assured by Vodafone that they would cover the almost 7 weeks of charges from Virgin as I had to take on a cancellation period before disconnection. When I finally got my closing bill from Virgin I contacted Vodafone via chat as agreed by the agent who said they would cover my losses. Eventually I had to switch to a phone call after I had been cut off from chat 3 times. When I got through on the phone the agent disputed that they had agreed to pay the accrued costs even though I had it screenshotted and he could see it on my account. I then was caught in a hellscape of trying to a) get them to understand that it is not my problem if their colleague has given out the wrong information and b) once he acknowledged that they should honour their word, trying to upload my final bill via a simultaneous chat as they don't do email?!!! I began this interaction at 11.30 am and as I type  at 3.23pm I am not yet done. Interspersed with some human comments are the inevitable AI generated generic comments which are beyond annoying. Oh, and at one point the agent asked me to have some patience and 'Wait!' said in what can only be described as an exasperated fashion. He also at one point offered me and then withdrew the offer of a ¬£10 voucher as I am not a mobile customer! Surely you can do better than this Vodafone. I am sorely disappointed that I am now contracted to you for 18 months as frankly you don't deserve the business.",,,2025-05-19T17:31:24.000Z

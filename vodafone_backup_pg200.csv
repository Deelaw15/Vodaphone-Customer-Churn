1,"Trying to buy broadband through Uswitch, then having multiple errors on checkout, only for customer services to say that they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt match third parties‚ÄôThere‚Äôs no matching needed, it‚Äôs a deal that‚Äôs come through from Uswitch!

1,"Held to ransom by a ‚Äòreputable‚Äô company. Purchased a sim only plan March 2023 for my mobile dongle. Service was fine for a while then poor so stopped using the sim in early 2024 but continued to pay as I had been told in a Vodafone shop that I would have to pay the full remainder of the sim plan up front to cancel early. At the end of the contract in March 2025 my 24 months was up so stopped paying. At this point I had paid over ¬£350 for a service I had not used, which as I said above, upon the advice of the person at Vodafone, I accepted. Today, (5/6/25) I received a letter from Vodafone for the first time (that was not them trying to get me to purchase their home broadband) dated 30/5/25 saying I had an outstanding bill of ¬£67.18, which had been sent to a debt collector and would be reported to the CRA on 4/6/25 which had already passed when I got the letter. I called Vodafone immediately, explained the situation and they demanded a payment of ¬£98.32 for 3 months of service that they continued to provide me as they said there was no record of my attempt to end the contract in 2024 or my issues with the poor service. I said to them that I had paid til the end of my contract and then cancelled but they said there was no record and that in order to cancel and avoid further charges I had to pay the almost ¬£100 which I certainly cannot afford. I an raising a formal complaint as I am disgusted by this greed and poor service. I want others to avoid the same experience that I have had. They‚Äôll happily take your money for a service they‚Äôre not providing. Recon they will still report to the CRA despite holding me to ransom and forcing me to pay something I can‚Äôt afford. Appalled. Avoid at all costs.",Chloe,GB,2025-06-05T20:24:59.000Z

1,"This is the complaint I submitted to Vodafone: I was about to move flat and so I have ordered a home broadband for 19A M** Street . 2 days later I realised it was actually 19B M** Street and so I called your number, one of your agent told me ""NO WORRIES! YOU CAN CHANGE THE ADDRESS EVEN AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE ROUTER, THAT'S OK"" and so I waited. The day came and waited for the activation which never happened, the same day my neighbour at 19A got his broadband deactivated because of YOUR mistake. So now I have to wait 2 more weeks for a new broadband to be activated in my address (AND I WORK FROM HOME) since you can't provide that to me and my neighbour will have to wait 10 days to have everything sorted out, BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOMPETENCE. While I am on the phone with this agent to sort everything out she told me that she submitted the complaint to her manager which would have called me.. eventually. That's funny because that OBVIOUSLY never happened. But what disgust me the most is that when I call the first time to change my address YOUR AGENT CHECKED IF 19B WAS FINE AND THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY ""YES IT IS"" EVEN THOUGH IN THEIR SCREENS IT WASN'T. I worked for Vodafone and I know how it works, I will make sure to spend 5 minutes everyday to write on every social and every reviews website how CRAP you actually are. Don't try to call me because I won't answer, emails only. You wasted 1 MONTH of my precious time, the minimum would be to receive a refund for the fuel I had to spend to go to the office everyday because of your incompetence.

1,I have been experiencing very very poor signal/reception using for phone calls to both incoming and outgoing voice keeps breaking and the signals bars change to one point more frequently in my area Slough Berkshire When spoke to customer service they asked me to pay off my whole contract amount to exit from Vodafone very frustrating and called couple times standing outside of my house to the network team but the calls keeping disconnected after the wait of 35 minutes initially some lift the call take all details to verify me and when they transferred the call to technical team after wait of half an hour the calls get disconnected with no response very frustrating.Called customer care and been waiting for over an hour to connect. Still hopeless to get the support from Vodafone every attempt to call for disconnection needs waiting for over an hour but when we call for new connection the calls keeping disconnected gets connected in 5 minutes,Bharath Bashetty,GB,2025-06-05T12:51:28.000Z

1,"I was a customer of BT‚Äôs full fibre service for two years, and switched to Vodafone only because of a cheaper offer ‚Äî and I deeply regret it! Their internet service is completely unreliable. Every time I struggle to get in touch ‚Äî due to Vodafone‚Äôs outdated and frustrating communication system ‚Äî I‚Äôm met with generic, meaningless responses. Their support team clearly lacks a basic understanding of simple networking concepts.Vodafone‚Äôs full fibre setup has fundamental issues, and the speeds they advertise simply don‚Äôt exist in practiceI am a professional Video Editor and always need to send a receiving large video files.

1,"After a formal complaint and a lengthy back-and-forth, Vodafone finally agreed to reduce my airtime from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11 a month and credited my account with ¬£50 ‚Äî supposedly covering two months. I thought the issue was resolved.Then suddenly, on 4 June, Vodafone took three separate payments from my account:‚Ä¢ ¬£25.46 (airtime ‚Äî which was supposed to be reduced!)‚Ä¢ ¬£10.00 (device)‚Ä¢ ¬£12.00 (device)I‚Äôm not disputing the device charges ‚Äî but the ¬£25.46 goes directly against what was agreed. Once again, I‚Äôm left chasing Vodafone for money I didn‚Äôt consent to pay, after being told this was sorted.This situation has added unnecessary financial pressure and stress, especially when I‚Äôve done everything Vodafone asked and acted in good faith. I‚Äôve now had to escalate again and CC the CEO. Why should I keep dealing with mistakes that Vodafone promised were resolved?This is unacceptable, and I hope this public review helps push for accountability ‚Äî again.After reaching a formal agreement with Vodafone (Ref: 138249138), I was told my airtime bill would drop from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11/month and that I had been credited ¬£50 to cover the next two months. I was finally starting to feel some relief after all the stress I‚Äôd already gone through.But despite this agreement, Vodafone took the full ¬£25.46 airtime payment again on 4 June ‚Äî on top of the ¬£10 and ¬£12 device plan payments. I never disputed the device charges, but the airtime charge should NOT have been taken.This isn't just a technical error ‚Äî it‚Äôs had a real and serious impact on me. I am already in a financial crisis, and this unnecessary charge has made things worse. I feel crippled by stress from having to deal with Vodafone over and over, especially after the rude and dismissive treatment I received from one of their representatives. That experience alone left a lasting emotional impact I still haven‚Äôt been able to move past.To feel some hope through a resolution, only to have it undone without explanation, has made things worse than before. This isn‚Äôt just poor service ‚Äî it‚Äôs neglectful and harmful.I've now had to escalate this again and CC Vodafone's CEO, Max Taylor, in my latest complaint. I‚Äôm also prepared to go to CISAS if this is not resolved swiftly and fairly. Enough is enough.",Farida Ali,GB,2025-06-05T15:54:34.000Z
1,Unfortunately can‚Äôt give zero stars. Vodafone make it as difficult as possible if want to change your contract or buy a sim only vodafone deal from carphone warehouse which they call a 3rd party provider. They want you to do a vodafone upgrade which essentially gives them more money (around ¬£100 more over contract term) and despite a couple of the staff on retention team stating you can do it with a post to post migration they continue to be as awkward as possible and simply want to make more sales. Spent hours on their utterly useless live chat presumably from India where their was a complete lack of communication. Unable to resolve any issues which aren‚Äôt straightforward. Telephoned retentions and on hold for 30 mins only to have the most useless member of staff Mohammad who stated I need to upgrade and have to get a pay as you go sim and transfer after 30 days. Called back next day to be told something completely different and don‚Äôt need to do that. Ended up doing an upgrade as loosing the will to live with them and just wanted it sorted. Definitely changing provider next time.,Ross,GB,2025-06-05T03:30:54.000Z

1,Pathetic service. The app was down on 3/6/25. I wasn‚Äôt aware at the time and called 191 at 3.27pm and spoke to the most incompetent call handler i have ever dealt with. He told me that Vodafone was no longer allowing top ups for any one on the app and that I would have to buy a voucher from a shop. I found this really odd and even asked for a PAC code to move providers . Luckily I didn‚Äôt listen to him and waited instead and the app issue replaced itself.

1,"I upgraded my device with the option to trade in - this was for the value of ¬£400.I was under the assumption that the ¬£400 credit would be applied to my account and I would pay my bill as usual. Vodafone received my device and confirmed the ¬£400 credit with a green banner within the MyVodafone app that stated ""You have ¬£400 account credit"".When it came to paying my bill, I received a notification that my Direct Debit would be ¬£400 higher this month. I called Vodafone and they advised that the credit could not be applied to my current bill, but I could use it on the next one. Meaning I would be ¬£400 down for a month. I am not really in a position to be able to do this, which is why I traded in the old device. I called Vodafone and asked if this could be refunded to my bank account if I made the payment - I was advised it could be. I hesitated paying this, as it would (and now has) put me in a difficult financial situation - I cannot be without broadband and mobile as I work from home, so today I paid the bill.I called Vodafone to ask about this credit being returned to me, and honestly feel like my intelligence is being questioned.. The agent I spoke to (Loretta) was very helpful, but told me initially that it owuldn't be possible to have the credit paid out to me as ""it is still accruing in the account, and is currently only at ¬£393.."" this makes absolutely no sense. Loretta went away to speak to some other team and came back and said that it would not be possible as that credit has not been ""allocated"".. even though I can see in a big green box that I have ¬£400 credit. I then asked Loretta if I could then just have the ¬£393, if that is what has ""accrued"". She went away again to speak to another team for quite a while and then came back to tell me this is not possible and I would have to wait until the next billing cycle. I then asked Loretta if she could confirm that that account credit would still be available when my next bill is issued, rather than being used to pay the bill and she said ""No, we will deduct the billed amount before sending the funds""I really feel like my intelligence is being insulted.. the account credit is there, it is not ""accruing"" - the device I traded in was a whole device, I didn't send it piece by piece so it makes no sense that the credit would ""accrue"". I understand that companies want to do as much as they can to not have to transfer funds out, but I was told that this was possible, without any caveats about the credit needing to accrue, or be allocated (it clearly has been allocated as I can see available credit within my app to be used!Please either arrange for a refund or return my device. I am now out of pocket due to a very poorly executed trade-in process and a billing team that clearly just want to try to avoid making any payouts.",Den,GB,2025-06-04T17:22:22.000Z

1,"10 weeks from planned activation date, Openreach finally finished the incomplete work to install our Full Fibre connection! Vodafone then instruct our current provider to disconnect us and leave us with no Internet connection at all!It's a very long story:Ordered our Vodafone full fibre on 7th JanChoose 1st available Openreach appointment - March 21st.  Prior to this, Openreach contractors dug up the path at the end of our driveway, not very neatly21st March arrives and Openreach engineer tells us he cannot fit the cable to the house becausethe initial ground works were not completed correctly. No rope to pull cable through conduit, ground junction box is filled with tarmac, no connection box installed on wall.2nd engineer apt is made for March 28th - still unable to complete as apparently there is a blockage!I chat every week to Vodafone who blame the issue on Opereach and every week say there is a blockage that requires a specialist engineer - the issue is with the chief engineer who has a heavy workload!On 17th may Vodafone say Openreach promise the work will be done by 23rd May which as predicted does not happen!23rd May - Vodafone agent has the sense to tell me they are raising an official escalation with Openreach. Unsure why this hasn't been done by any other of the agents until so far down the line!2nd June - Openreach engineer calls me and says will arrive in 20mins. Finishes the connection within half hour and says it is up and running. He doesn't know what the blockage or issue is meant to be as he has no problem running the cable inside or connecting the router so who knows what we have been waiting for over the last 10 weeks!Shortly after he leaves, Vodafone instruct my provider to disconnect but the new Vodafone connection doesn't start working!That afternoon, I spend 1hr speaking to tech support going through troubleshooting and they finally tell me they will send a new router as firmware out of date.3rd June - I chat online to ask for confirmation the router will arrive today. Tech support now tell me that there is nothing wrong with the router as it is a new Power Hub!Whilst another agent is trying to find out what the issue is, I get disconnected from my mobile data as a result of trying to connect to WiFi as asked.  I then reconnect to yet another agent!I reconnect to another agent and speak to him for an hour, switching, unplugging, resetting, updating etc then get disconnected again as I am relying on mobile data!I rejoin the queue and chat to agent no 3, really loosing hope now! They then say they will pass me to the activations team as my order is still in open status! They have obviously admitted defeat! I asked to speak to a manager but apparently I have to speak to an activations team member first! Speak to this team member who asks me yet again to reset the router and updates something their end! Of course it doesn't make any difference and they transfer me to a manager. Turns out yesterday's promised router won't arrive until tomorrow but they place yet another order to send a 2nd one out today! They have gone back to believing the router needs replacing because of the firmware which strangely can't be done remotely. Speak to shift mgr who just repeats what I have already been told.  End my chat at 4hrs!4th June - Amazingly, the new router arrives and actually connects to the new network! I'm hoping this is the last time I need to chat to Vodafone but am not optimistic! Since January we have been paying ¬£14 more per mth to our existing provider as we are out of contract! The max compensation Vodafone will pay is ¬£374.40 (¬£6.24 x 60 days) This is the only reason we haven't cancelled. We also have 2 Vodafone mobile contracts in the household but although the internet is up and running now, I will not be choosing Vodafone for anything again in the future, due to how this was handled. I have been told today, the compensation won't be applied to my account until August. The least they could do is apply it to the 1st bill",Cath,GB,2025-06-04T16:17:47.000Z

1,Bad all over. even if they resolve the issue. I wont remove this comment because it should not have happened in the first place.  I signed up for ¬£29 contact. asked clearly on the call if I will incur extra charges. Was advised no. It took 4 week for the installation. was told I will get compensation for ¬£6 a day delay. I get my first bill . its ¬£59 been asked to pay it as they didn‚Äôt do the DD when I asked them to. which makes me ask why did they take my DD details if DD was not set up?

4,"Having been with Vodafone for at least 10 years now, I decided to leave this year, as the offers weren't as cheap anymore for what I need. I never cared much for the latest phone but needed roaming, minutes and texts as well as some data. Due to my job, I received 20% off the bill and still paid about ¬£28 per month. This doesn't appear a lot compared to some people who pay ¬£50-¬£60 with a phone included but overall, they have always been responsive and helpful. The network is hit and miss at times but I can't fault them for having been a good company but unfortunately your rates don't compare to other companies these days, who offer similar Sim only deals for half the price. Now I pay ¬£7 per month with no price rises, roaming included, unlimited texts and minutes and 30GB data per month, which rolls over, so ideal for me.",Jasmin,GB,2025-06-04T15:18:57.000Z

1,"I have been a Vodafone broadband customer for since last 3 years; I started facing issues 1 year later. I am out of my Vodafone contract since October 2025. Now I left my old rented home on May 19, 2025 .When I requested for a disconnection with Vodafone on 25 April 2025 they told they could only disconnect on 26th May 2025. So I agreed, and they raised the disconnection request. I got a confirmation email and a sorry to see u go email on the same day from Vodafone. Then After 3 weeks, on May 14, they took the bill for June and send another confirmation email saying i am disconnecting services on 27th of June. When I approached the Vodafone support, they didn't have any clue they escalated to 3 different teams, wasted 3 hours in chat and later they told I wouldn't be able to disconnect because the new tenant raised an connection request with another vendor, and hence I need to continue to pay the bill until they find the issue. So I removed my debit last week, as I am not using the internet, and moved out of the rented house on 19th MAY. although  I already lost the payment taken for June month .The reason is so silly; I don't know how a reputed company can behave in a stupid way.  After all these conversations, the customer care team is asking me to take a mobile data plan which looks like they are least bothered about their customer concerns rather than selling their product. Now I can see a couple of bills have been generated till July 2025 hope they will continue for an infinite number of day even though they don't have any connection. I am not sure what to do. Do I need to go to consumer court or complain about this to Ofcom? Anyone, please advice .",Anoop,GB,2025-06-04T14:20:18.000Z

1,"Ok, so whilst this seems a great deal, despite promises, Vodafone do not contact you to let you know your deal is about to end. In 2 months my Broadband increased from just under ¬£12 to ¬£37, however, due to DD payment dates, I realised on day of Mays payment it had increased and was already into Junes payment, over 200% increase. I have spent over a week and 2 hours on the phone trying to rectify this, however, you are totally reliant one ""special"" department contacting you...... they haven't.  This is disgraceful Vodafone.",Sam Woods,GB,2025-06-03T19:54:18.000Z

1,"The Vodafone Installations Team have not been helpful when I switched to Vodafone and had a problem with Openreach. They seemed content to do nothing even when I stated that Openreach had offered to see if they could expedite the problem. Whoever I spoke to at Vodafone would not let me speak to the Installations Team, they spoke to them and parroted back the date I was given, NOT bothering to contact Openreach. Vodafone think that more digging needs to be done, I can see the roll of cable already in my porch.  I signed up on April 9th, was given an installation date of May 6th. A problem with the conduit meant that I went into the 3-week wait till next visit by the civils team - great people and they seemed to fix it, just that Vodafone don't seem to have bothered to update anything - ""fob him off, we don't want to chase anything"" seems to be the team motto. I can't decide whether to ditch the lot or persevere as they are alleged to have a better signal, and I guess that's what they depend on, never mind customer service.  So still no Broadband since April 12th.",Mr Mitchell,GB,2025-06-03T17:48:16.000Z

I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life and which you wouldn't get from 02 or EE. Totally unprofessional and unhelpful and was quite rude to me about it.Does the CEO of Vodafone know what the Customer Service Desk is doing?Go elsewhere but don't use Vodafone!!",Anon,GB,2025-06-03T12:41:53.000Z

2,"Today, while on my way to do my grocery shopping, I came across a distressed woman‚Äîshe was homeless and had special needs. She couldn‚Äôt top up her phone and didn‚Äôt understand why. I checked the phone for her: the device was working fine and could dial out, but none of the top-up service numbers were functioning.After a quick search, I saw a surge in complaints about Vodafone outages. It looked like whatever issue was affecting your systems had also taken out the top-up service.This woman was already going through a lot‚Äîher husband had recently passed away, and she was trying to sort out essential things like medical appointments and other urgent support. Being cut off from her only means of communication was the last thing she needed.I contacted Vodafone support using my own phone and waited 30 minutes before being transferred to the top-up line. The person I spoke to gave me a number, then immediately tried to end the call. I stopped her‚Äîafter waiting that long, I wasn‚Äôt going to be left without answers. But the number didn‚Äôt work. Neither of the two numbers she gave me worked.In the end, I used my own debit card to top up the woman‚Äôs phone, because there was no working way to do it otherwise.Please investigate this. Your system failure left a vulnerable person cut off and unsupported, and that‚Äôs not just a technical issue‚Äîit has real human consequences.",Yves Wheeler,GB,2025-06-02T23:14:33.000Z

1,"My husband and I decided  to switch to Vodafone for our broadband supplier and booked for installation on 22/5/25It‚Äôs now 2/6/25 and we have had no live broadband service as yet from them following this installation.Now spent a total of approx 4 hours on webchat with them (using mobile data as hey we don‚Äôt have broadband ü§î thanks to Vodafone.) also spent about an hour on telephone with them - still no further forward.  Missed the champions league final on tv, can‚Äôt stream tv, can‚Äôt work from home or check emails and no end in sight currently.  Running through data on phone to stay online as no other alternative.Had a communication from Vodafone on 23/5/25 apologising that broadband not working yet but not to do anything and they would sort it.  Waited 7 days and then we got in touch with them - if we hadn‚Äôt I am sure we would still be waiting on an update from them. I appreciate there are teething problems sometimes with a new service but the fact there has been no resolution and we are still waiting is not good enough.A communications company that can‚Äôt communicate with its customers doesn‚Äôt fill you with confidence - the fact that they can‚Äôt even guarantee connection on the webchat facility without you pressing a . every 60 seconds doesn‚Äôt again inspire confidence and competence with them.Wish we had stayed with our old supplier now",fiona mccallum,GB,2025-06-02T18:18:35.000Z

1,"Broadband - delays, wasted time and a lot of hard workOriginally signed up via an intermediary site that promised a voucher that never turned up. Service was delayed by 5 months as attempt after attempt to provide the service failed  and customer service was painful.When connected things were ok until I wanted to move. The service is run to minimise costs so ask the bot to speak to a person and it asks irrelevant questions.When you do speak to a person their scripts are too long winded and involve waiting while their machines process thingsIn the end they would not deliver the equipment without me attending a shop. It took 90 mins to get to that point & I wasn't going to take an afternoon of time just to prove who I amIf I never have to speak to Vodafone it'll be too soon",Mike W,GB,2025-06-02T16:05:56.000Z

1,I ordered fibre broadband from Vodafone on 29/11/2024. It is now June 2025 and I am still not connected. Their complaints service is next to useless - you communicate with a customer service centre that has no idea what is going on and no idea how to resolve problems. They ignore specific questions and request for escalation. They say it's not their fault or Openreach's fault but because civils are required to bring the line from the other side of the street so surveys are required by Openreach. In fact Openreach have 3 times sent people to carry out a survey and come up with a solution for connection. $ times Openreach have sent people to connect my home to the line that they haven't put in yet.Vodafone seem to have no basic service level agreement with Openreach or are not enforcing it. On the positive side they have sent me two broadband routers!,Iain Hill,GB,2025-06-02T13:26:29.000Z

1,Vodafone Broadband. Simple house move and attempt to have broadband reconnected at new address. All records held by Vodafone incorrect or out of date. Reconnection cancelled by Vodafone with no notice whatsoever; had to call to find out it had been cancelled. All records again incorrect having apparently been corrected when reconnection booked. Woeful. Avoid!,Richard Brown,GB,2025-06-02T12:10:34.000Z
1,"Contacted for an up to date delivery date for broadband router. For most companies this requires confirmation of a few details e.g. order number, post code, etc. and admittedly I should have been more prepared with details to hand. However, for Vodafone you have to even recall the last contact you had with them and whether this was over chat, email or phone. The whole process must have taken around 30 minutes. Had to wait a long time between responses from Vodafone customer service agent and was given many non-responses and time fillers e.g. ""I am checking the details"" which likely meant ""I am helping another customer"". Every time my connection dropped slightly I received a  reply saying they had not heard from me in quite some time despite me having to wait a long time between their responses. Let's just hope the broadband is better than their customer service so I don't have to contact them again.  Would not recommend using the chat service at all if possible and next time I will phone but for people who rely on chat for accessibility reasons this would not be possible. I think I've unfortunately passed the 14 day cooling off period as my soonest activation date and delivery date were a long time from my order date otherwise I would probably be cancelling my order and going with another provider.",Jessica Murray,GB,2025-06-02T12:08:23.000Z

1,"New switch to Vodafone - took months to connect up, which wasn't an issue for me as understood they needed to connect the line in under a road. However then my issues started, on switch day the new router didn't work and they turned the previous supplier off so left me without the internet for a work day (and I work from home) They had to post a new router out which needed to be signed for, however they did not understand that being in to sign for this when I had to do 5 hour round trip to the office to be able to work, was not understood. Just over 2 weeks later, no internet on Saturday but then came back and started working this morning ok and now it's gone again - they need to send an Openreach engineer, coming tomorrow - no internet again and over an hour on the phone to them, absolutely awful service and wishing I'd never switched to them, customer service is appalling!",suzanne Kissane,GB,2025-06-02T11:18:03.000Z

I spent a couple of hours troubleshooting it without a resolution, It has been escalated to the ""network team' twice (they closed the first ticket off without any communication).  I got them to open another ticket and they have requested screenshots of my phone screen and postcode of where I was at the time, I sent 2 over and now they say they need 3 screenshots with exact times, oh and I can only send them over betwen Thursday and Sunday!?? Are Vodafone a Mickey Mouse company now?  They have now closed off the second ticket!! I cant help feeling they dont really want to help and they know there is a wider issue since the 3G service was switched off.

1,"Engineer came and drilled through a pipe, lots of water and damage.  Lost access to a room in my home for nearly a month, had to take lots of time out so I could be there for lots of additional appointments and spend my own money for paint and cleaning products.  It took 3 further appointments just to get the broadband on.  Then when raising a complaint, Vodafone take no ownership, close my complaint and leave me waiting on the third party engineers to recognise a complaint despite my contract being with them.  Possibly the worst choice of provider, definitely not one click switch.",nicholas stewart,GB,2025-05-31T17:07:33.000Z

1,"We have experienced multiple issues with Vodafone broadband and the final nail in the coffin is them terminating the wrong line meaning we are unable to work. Apparently it will take 2 weeks to reinstate. The problem before that was when we terminated a line and they continued to take our money for months. We have lost hours on the phone to incompetent agents, time we will never get back and was a complete waste of time. The broadband service itself was pretty unreliable so this is the end!",Eva Fryer,GB,2025-05-31T16:04:35.000Z

1,"I contacted Vodafone after closing my bank account and asked them to cancel the direct debit as the account no longer exists. They refused. I tried again a few days later and explained as if I was talking to a child that it would cause problems with my payment if the direct debit is attempted.They again refused to cancel the direct debit. This went on for multiple phone calls and multiple complaints.The direct debit was taken out of the closed bank account indicating the payment was made. I made a manual payment.The direct debit was then returned to the bank in question. The next day I get a text and email saying my bill is unpaid. Now they are saying I haven't made my bill payment and I have to pay them again. If I don't my account will be restricted and I'll receive late payment fees.So, I explain the bank account in question is closed. I explain that the direct debit will fail and cause me to have a late payment or it'll cause problems with the manual payment. Yet they knowingly refuse to act accordingly putting my finances, and communications at risk. The company hasn't changed in 15 years. Still thieves and liars.I would strongly recommend anyone considering joining Vodafone looks for a different communication provider. Vodafone will destroy your credit score, they will destroy your mental health, they will destroy your life. And they will make you pay for the privilege.Got a text at 6.45 This morning saying I'd get a callback between 12 and 2 today. It goes past 2pm and I call to find out what happened. Only to be told the agent who text me isn't at work today. The whole company is absolutely useless. Full of liars and thieves.I've wasted all the time I'm prepared. If my problem isn't fixed today I'll close my accounts. I'm not dealing with thieves and liars",Philip Marshall,GB,2025-05-31T13:35:35.000Z

1,Extremely dissapointed with the service. I had taken out an online package with Vodafone on the 13th April. I had been promised an engineer would attend my property as soon as possible. It is now the 30th May and I still haven't had my Internet activated. They gave me an appointment on the 28th May with an engineer for a home visit. I stayed home the whole day and nobody showed up. They had called me today with excuses and justifications. I was told The next available engineer would be able to come on the 11th July. Very unhappy with Vodafone for wasting my time and energy.

1,20 yrs ago Vodafone screwed me.  They haven't changed. My husband decided to leave Vodafone for a better deal. He was paying over ¬£20 for a SIM card only. They kept on asking for more and more information due to 'security'. They cut him off so he couldn't use his phone because of security. We had to ring an 0333 number. We were on the phone 1 HR and 30 mins due to the their incompetency. I've just discovered we have been charged ¬£4.50 for that pleasure.

1,"I ordered a new phone on their website for delivery 2 days later. I had to contact them 2 days later as I hadn‚Äôt received any further communication and they promised I‚Äôd hear back within 48 hours. After 48 hours I contacted them again as I still hadn‚Äôt received any communication and I was told the phone was ‚Äòstuck‚Äô at the warehouse but that they ‚Äòguarantee‚Äô I‚Äôll hear from them within 7 days‚Ä¶ contacted them again 8 days later as I still hadn‚Äôt received any contact at all from them and was told the order had to be cancelled because the warehouse didn‚Äôt receive the signed plan - the same signed plan I was sent via email on the day I ordered. Even when I offered to send them the signed document they had sent me with the time stamp of the day of purchase they couldn‚Äôt accept. Clearly some issues with their warehouse and sales/website not communicating and a complete void of any customer service as not once have I been contacted to apologise for the inconvenience of not receiving my order or having to contact them to find out what‚Äôs happening rather than the other way around. Anyway, can‚Äôt place the same order from them for another 24 hours whilst the other one is cancelled, plenty of time to look elsewhere!",Matthew Philpott,GB,2025-05-30T16:59:04.000Z

Instead of receiving the usual Vodafone confirmation I  received one from ''prepaidmobilerecharge.com'' On checking I discovered the the original balance had disappeared and my balance was ¬£10. Was I scammed. On speaking with Vodafone it turned out that because another company used what appeared to be the official Vodafone  web site I had been tricked into giving scammers my Debit card details. Posting my complaint on to the scam website ''prepaidmobilerecharge.com''my rating was changed from 1 Star to 4 stars,Colin Fellows,GB,2025-06-03T16:14:55.000Z
1,"I‚Äôm one of those people that chop and change broadband providers to get a good deal so I went with Vodafone despite reading bad reviews, thinking ‚Äò they‚Äôre a big company I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine‚Äô.I was wrong.Customer service is terrible, impossible to get hold of ( one time over an hour and a half on hold and still no answer). Total incompetence from staff as well, one will say one thing and you‚Äôll get past around from one department to another and the next person will contradict the previous person on what is causing an issue ect. I spent over 3 hours one night trying to get our internet working after activation after a house move and it was painful tbh. I got nowhere and in the end I gave up. I tried again the next night on their Tobi online chat and this time I was hit with different reasons as to why it was still not working. Again no connection. At this point I went on my sky app to go back with them as I‚Äôd had enough, so then tried to leave Vodafone which was also ridiculously impossible. Was I at the beginning of a contact as I‚Äôd just moved or was I still on monthly rolling as I‚Äôd been with them nearly two years? Again I was getting mixed messages from Vodafone with one person saying one thing and the next one saying the opposite. It was almost like a wind up the service was so bad.I was also told  that the 3 weeks I wasn‚Äôt receiving any service after moving house that I would not be getting changed, but guess what? They did charge me the full amount!In the end, in their compete and utter uselessness they mucked up in my favour as on the third consecutive night of phoning them I actually spoke to a ‚ÄòSamantha‚Äô who tbh was the only decent staff member I dealt with. While on the phone basically pleading with her to just cancel my service so I could go elsewhere she mentioned I took out my contract with them  STARTING IN DECEMBER 2025 when we were still in MAY 2025! I told her to repeat what she just said and as she was doing so stopped mid sentence and realised the total ball‚Äôs up in apparently starting a contract in the future. This was my get out as the contract was null and void and she agreed to cancel my contract immediately! Phew!! Samantha admitted she had no idea how that had happened, and it was for me at least my get out from the worst service by a country mile I‚Äôve ever encountered from any company regardless of size let alone a big one like Vodafone.TLTR. Don‚Äôt be like me and ignore the negative reviews like I did, thinking you‚Äôll be ok. You won‚Äôt.",Aaron Hudson,GB,2025-05-29T21:05:59.000Z

1,"They sold me fibre 150 which guaranteed at least 75mb but i never get anything above 40mb.  They use the excuse that they can only guarantee speeds if your connected via cable which nobody can really do as most routers are in a cupboard in a hallway.  They then have the cheek to offer you booster boxes which would increase your bill and if you want to cancel its over ¬£100 so your basically trapped with rubbish internet. Dont get me started on customer service, yes you will always get through to someone after waiting but they never offer you a solution and talk to you like your a child after jumping through hoop after hoop before you even get to speak about your issue.",Mark Miller,GB,2025-05-29T20:25:18.000Z
1,"Back in January I spoke to Vodafone as I had changed jobs and my pay day meant I would have to change my payment date to 1st of each month, they confirmed it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and due to billing cycle wouldn‚Äôt take affect until March. Spoke to Vodafone today as my direct debit was meant to be taken on 1st of each month, explained they took the bill early which has meant I have gone overdrawn (pay day is tomorrow) Spent two long hours on the phone and I was told it was mistake their end but it‚Äôs impossible to move billing cycle so I should have never been told the 1st is ok. By way of recompense they offered ¬£5 Morrisons voucher. I explained this should never have happened and the overdraft fee alone would be more than this paltry amount. The lady disappeared and offered a ¬£10 e voucher on her return. Each time she said that it was the best she could do. Clearly both were lies! So even though it‚Äôs Vodafone mess up nothing was offered as fair compensation. Luckily I‚Äôm out of fixed contracts with Vodafone and have moved all my accounts elsewhere which is a shame as I had been with them for the better part of 18 years. After numerous mess ups over the years this was the final straw. They did offer to match what I had found but still couldn‚Äôt move my direct debit to the 1st of each mont, had they been able to do that I would have been tempted to stay. After testing my wired/wifi connection also turns out I‚Äôm getting less than their minimum guaranteed! (I have gigafast package) Also the lack of 5g in my area is also annoying. I feel Vodafone can and should be doing more for their loyal customers.",Leigh Mcshane,GB,2025-05-29T19:17:03.000Z

1,"I am constantly having slower broadband speeds than I have been guaranteed in my contract. I go through Vodaphones trouble shooting process which always comes back to say my internet is fine although when I have done speed tests on my phone or Xbox they are around 125mps slower than my guaranteed lowest speed. You then try to talk to an actual human and very conveniently the website will freeze and none of the buttons will do anything. I can't be the only one this happens to and what I don't understand is how they just get away with it by ignoring you.

Five days before my contract was due to expire I was phoned by an aggressive, rude salesman (he certainly had not undertaken customer service training) to renew my contract.

5,"I spent days trying to collect a Gigacube router ordered via chat, however due to a typo added by the operator, IDV check failed at the store and I could not collect it. Surprisingly, no one at Vodafone could fix my name in my account. The only option was for me to submit a name change request which required the account number which I still didn't have since it was not activated yet. So basically I got locked out and no one could sort it out at Vodafone and the only option (less stressful) was to let the order expire and be canceled.Hopefully, I went to Vodafone Covent Garden to re-order it where I was assisted by Huseyin and Qasim who went above and beyond to ensure I had my plan placed and internet activated. I highly recomment reaching out to them, especially Qasim who overcame system's limitations to ensure my problem was resolved.

He took great trouble to make sure that the new IPhone 16 was user ready and more importantly new user understood and was both charming and extremely patient with 2 elderly women.

As said a quite exceptional level of customer care and service.",Morrison,GB,2025-05-28T16:57:13.000Z

1,Ordered a Vodafone 150 broadband package. On the day of connection I plugged in the power and ethernet cable as directed. It wouldn't connect. Couldn't speak to anyone directly so spent the next 6 hours on web chats. First 3 agents disappeared and the last one didn't inspire confidence. I had to cancel and go to new supplier. Vodafone back up was pathetic and they need to allow agents to converse in order to resolve. Never again!!,Joe Kelly,GB,2025-05-28T15:36:41.000Z

1,"I've been with Vodafone for some time now and I really can't wait to get out of my contract so I can find another provider. This has got to be the worst broadband I've had and I thought virgin media was bad! My broadband keeps dropping out, I've lost service for multiple weeks throughout the year which means I've had loss of income due to losing our on work (which Vodafone have NOT reimbursed me for). I can't stream without there being some kind of connection issues.nive spoken to multiple agents at the company all of which have no idea what they're doing! The last agent I spoke to transferred me to about 3 or 4 different people and I ended up with someone trying to sign me up as a new customer!!! Absolute shambles! Any review telling you Vodafone is the best overall provider must be lying. If I was you, I'd avoid at all costs. For a company that is legally contracted to provide a paid service, they do the complete opposite. I'm going to call Vodafone and demand they cancel the contract on their behalf due to their failure of providing the service I'm paying for!",MR,GB,2025-05-27T22:51:16.000Z

If it was a third party and not Vodafone how on earth did they know my Vodafone account number? Vodafone now refusing to cancel the contract unless I pay an early termination of ¬£56.

1,"This has been a terrible experience with Vodafone. I needed to move home while still under contract with them. I called more than two weeks before my moving date to arrange broadband activation at my new address. The customer service representative assured me that someone would come to install and activate the broadband on the scheduled day.However, no one showed up, and I received no communication or updates. I then called customer service and spent over an hour on the phone. The representative promised that her manager would call me back within 24 to 48 hours ‚Äî but, once again, no one followed through.After five days without internet and no updates, I called again. This time, someone based in the UK informed me that the installation had been rescheduled for more than a week later. I requested compensation, as I would be without internet for almost half a month while still being charged the full monthly fee. The customer service agent, however, made every excuse to avoid offering any compensation.It was only after I mentioned reporting the issue to Ofcom that the agent finally took the matter seriously and said she would check for an earlier installation date. The new date is now six days away, but I have still received no compensation for being without internet for over 10 days ‚Äî not to mention the stress and frustration of dealing with their customer service.This has been a dreadful experience. I used to live in the U.S., and people often complained about AT&T ‚Äî a provider I used for many years. But compared to Vodafone, AT&T feels like an angel. I will I will report my case to Ofcom anyway.",Jason,GB,2025-05-27T15:51:49.000Z

I did not realise that, in the world of Vodafone, this constituted an 'upgrade' and therefore a new contract. I found a much better deal at ¬£5 per month and now have a termination fee of ¬£361 to pay!! Since they were charging me for needless insurance I think they owe me.

5,"What a difference it is to get great customer service! I've always preferred to speak to someone face to face instead of using call centres. I went to Vodafone Merry Hill as I was interested in swapping to their broadband but had questions that needed answers. Step forward Ryan, who was a star! He knew exactly what I needed and explained how full fibre would be installed. I definitely didn't want my drive dug up, and it won't be. Ryan went out of his way for us, and evengot us a much better deal on our mobiles. He swapped us from our old provider, got the PAC codes, I didn't have to do a thing. Highly recommended store and staff. The following day I was going to swop my phone using Samsung Switch only to find that my Samsung phone didn't support it! Went back to Vodafone Merry Hill to see Ryan, who was busy at the time, but another member of staff sorted the phone in minutes. You are genuinely in safe hands!

1,"My Internet didn't work for 3 months, going through vodafone phone system to try and resolve the issue is unbearable, everytime on hold for at least 45min before anyone picks up only to be transferred from department to department. Every question I asked involves me being put on hold for 20min wile they have to ask someone else for an answer. Everything I told them about the Internet not working involves them having to tell someone else and again being put on hold for another 20min. OUTRAGEOUS!!!Once the problem was raised they send me a txt message in the evening saying the problem had been resolved when it haven't. So the next day I had to do it all again, for 3 months. The total time I was on the phone to them was well over 40hours. OUTRAGEOUS!!! I have been through terrible phone systems before from other companies but nothing even comes close to how bad vodafone are. During the 3 months my Internet didn't work they never forgot to charge me. Eventually after 3 months they got my Internet working, I asked them about getting a refund, they said I get a refund for the period of time my Internet was down but it won't be applied to my account for 2 months, 3 months later I was still being charged, I rang them again to ask why? Another 45min just to get through to someone, everything I asked involves me being put on hold for 15min to get an answer, eventually they said I was owed a refund and can I stay on hold wile they calculated it, it took over an hour to work out apparently because my Internet was down for so long only for them to say I'm not getting any refund. I asked why? Another 15min on hold to be told because I missed 1 call from them (because I was at work and couldn't pick up my phone) that is enough of a reason for them to say I delayed the process. I asked when was this call? Another 20min on hold to be told it was 2 months into my Internet being down. So no refund even for the 2 months before this apparently phone call, OUTRAGEOUS!!! And that's all they need to deny you any refund at all for not providing a service there charging you for.If you speak to vodafone wanting to take out a contract you go through to an English call centre, if you have a problem you go though to an Indian call centre, where the hold times are insane OUTRAGIOUS!!! Like I said total time I was on the phone to vodafone was over 40 hours and probably more like 60hours. I've never known anything like it.",Chris,GB,2025-05-26T17:00:26.000Z

2,Having been a loyal customer of Vodafone went to the Store to ask for a new phone. There was a complete misunderstanding. I wanted a new contract new number NOT the upgrade that I was given. This misunderstanding had caused a lot of stress . I had to phone yesterday which took over an hour to sort. I've had to order a new sim card for more money over 18 months now  .An adjustment has been made to my device now for more money which I didn't even want  just total confusion and frustration. I'm considering leaving Vodafone at the earliest opportunity now,sarah ianson,GB,2025-05-26T10:36:07.000Z
1,Absolutely atrocious. I switched my roaming off on a holiday to American as I had purchased an esim from a much cheaper provider. I must not have switched the roaming off correctly as it charged me three times my monthly bill. I contacted Vodafone as soon as I got home and they said to get back to them after the bill is generated (which I did today!) Spoke to them today and was told they wouldn't help me out with a genuine mistake and it was completely my fault! Genuinely surprised at how unsupportive they were with this genuine mistake. Made no attempt to help at all. I'll be leaving as soon as possible.,Sam,GB,2025-05-26T09:37:26.000Z

1,"Location: Cambridgelets start about a year ago, and everywhere I went around Cambridge and the surrounding areas I was struggling to get a signal on vodafone. I called and they ran me through the usual of getting the most up to date carrier settings for my phone (this was repeated many times I called vodafone), but this did not fix the issue. The phone was not the issue as I bought a Pixel 9 and experienced the same issue.I had a strong signal (full 4G) but I could not get and bandwidth and it became so bad that at around 4-6pm, if I wanted to make a call, I would have to disable 4G to actually make a call.I reported all this to vodafone, but nobody on the team could understand the difference between signal and bandwidth.Fast forward to just recently, and I called asking to cancel my contract, at first they tried to run me through troubleshooting, then asking what I had been offered in other places, and after 20 minutes of me refusing to answer their questions and just asking to cancel my contract, they put the phone down.I called again very angry and luckily had somebody that just processed the cancellation with no questions, however it took over 30 minutes to do this.Not had any issues on EE yet, but I will not be touching Vodafone againEdit: I'm gone, you can't get me back. Do better with the customers you have and train your staff to understand why a client might get no data despite having full signal. I won't be wasting anymore time talking to your poor customer support",Ben,GB,2025-05-25T20:04:02.000Z

I had to spend 2 hours on the phone to them to get them to obey it.Then they billed me for the service I had cancelled and told me that they would refund it to me the following month.Then they did not actually refund me the money they owed me.  I had to spend another 40 minutes demanding that they give me my money back, and then they told me that they would only refund me in June.",Stuart Barrett,GB,2025-05-25T14:51:33.000Z

When I tried to complaint, they put me on hold for 3 hours and would not let me complaint. Then put on pay as you go. Now they are trying to charge me ¬£600.00 for them moving me from a contract to pay as you go. If you use VODAFONE move to ANYONE ELSE ASAP.Dear Vodafone, So rather than you contact me you want me to try contacting you again? I dont use Facebook or X, is there a number (not 3 hours via you call centres) that I can call you or someone who can resolve this in minutes not hours?

1,"Excellent, so good and honest. The best experience I've had in mobile phone shop.Update: I was told phone number would change over by 4pm Tuesday. Still not changed by this evening Wednesday. Phoned the customer service and was told the request had not been actioned. So they had to do this today so will not be able to use phone until Fri/ Sat. A full week after purchase so told customer advisor that I was paying under 2 contracts due to their error, told to take it up with the shop as it was my word and I cannot prove it as they have no record! üò° So basically called a liar. Then thought maybe I should double check the package I've been sold. Went onto my vodaphone could not access, they asked for a password. Never had one so. Tried to set up a new account for it to stare I already had one. So clicked on forgot password. Came up that an email has been sent to my email but the email address doesn't exist or if it does, does not belong to me which is worrying that my data could be breached. So I phone again to be told they cannot amend my email address. I now have to go back to the shop on Saturday to sort it. Absolutely fuming!! üò°üò°",Sharon Whittall,GB,2025-05-28T20:19:13.000Z

1,"I would have given a zero star rating if possible, and that would have been more than the company deserves. They are utterly useless. We have been experiencing problems with them for a while and my partner just switched to another company with a PAYG SIM to escape them. We could not use their app, or even get the money they kept taking from us translated into phone credit. We have still not been able to get them to close the account, and they continue to take money. We have had to close our Bank Account to stop them taking money. It is causing other problems now because the new bank account with another company is not yet up and running.In short, Vodafone are a bunch of clowns! Avoid them at all costs.",STEPHEN LOCKLEY,GB,2025-05-23T22:03:39.000Z

1,"I made a decision to switch from current BB provider to Vodafone after reading reviews. Ordered the home BB service on 9th May 2025 via Uswitch link as they were offering a ¬£90 gift card reward.Received email confirmation and chose installation date as Thursday 29th May. Email stated that equipment would arrive 3 working days before installation date which I realised would be a bank holiday Monday.I called up to enquire about the installation only to be informed that the order had been cancelled without any explanation. First customer service staff member blamed uSwitch and said they had cancelled.I emailed uSwitch and they responded promptly saying they did not store any information on their systems as all information and order would have been processed and credit checks done through the Vodafone website.I called customer service again. This time it was a lady on the phone who checked account again and informed me that the order had been cancelled and the account was credit check pending. Lady offered to reorder which I declined as that meant I would lose out on the ¬£90 cash back offer from uSwitch.Within the last two weeks there was no communication via email or phone to inform me of the status of my order. I only learnt of the outcome when I phoned up.And now seeing there are 30% complaints with customers leaving 1 start reviews, I am contemplating of remaining with my current home BB provider.",Sohail Anjum,GB,2025-05-23T20:00:55.000Z

Only to recieve more emails saying the account was active. Called to check, only to be told i would now be liable for 'early termination fees' even though i was within the 14 day cool off period & the device never worked.

1,"Vodafone has delivered, without a doubt, the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever encountered. I‚Äôve been a customer for over six months, and during this time, I‚Äôve been completely unable to access my account. This has prevented me from resetting up a direct debit, which has led to overcharge and unjustified late fees.I‚Äôve spent more than four hours on the phone with their support team, being bounced around between departments, only to be told time and again that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do.‚Äù Not only have they failed to fix the issue, they refuse to take responsibility or even remove the fees caused by their own broken systems. They also refuse to transfer me to their managers. The only thing vodafone proposes to its clients is to pay more, for an unexistant service.The level of incompetence and indifference is staggering. Vodafone clearly has no interest in helping their customers, resolving issues, or even providing basic functionality. It‚Äôs astonishing that a major telecom company can operate with such a blatant disregard for its customers.I will be filing a formal complaint with the Communication & Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS). If you‚Äôre considering Vodafone‚Äîdon‚Äôt. Spare yourself the stress and look elsewhere.Edit: the late fee has been cancelled after 2h30 on the phone. But I am still not able to connect to my account.",reviewer,FR,2025-05-23T13:33:11.000Z

1,You can only cancel your plan one time of year. If you cancel outside of this window you have to pay for the remaining year. What a scam. I have been a loyal customer for more than 10 years and now I have moved away from the uk and have to pay for a plan I have no use for for 7 months.,AnneSofie,GB,2025-05-23T09:55:04.000Z

1,"I recently joined Vodafone but am beginning to regret this decision. I changed bank current accounts which resulted in a direct debit for Vodafone not being transferred over. As soon as they alerted me to this fact I set up anew one the same day. Despite this I was charged a fee by Vodafone for payment being less than a week late. I tried to query Vodafone‚Äôs eagerness to charge a fee but I found to my cost that their customer service is woeful. There is no way to email Vodafone, instead you are directed to a totally inept web chat that I assume is manned by poorly trained call centre staff working from a script. Vodafone appear to copying Amazon‚Äôs lead by making it difficult to lodge a formal complaint in the hope that people will just give up. I have emailed Vodafone‚Äôs CEO to pass on my complaint but it seems that he too is not interested in dealing with adverse customer feedback. As yet I‚Äôve had no reply.I would advise anyone to avoid Vodafone and will be changing provider as soon as my contract is up.I‚Äôm sure that I will get a generic response from Vodafone directing me to a Facebook page if I wish to discuss the matter further. I do not, nor do I wish to join Facebook.",Paul,GB,2025-05-22T22:49:55.000Z

1,"For 2 months I have been waiting for new connection, after 3 weeks of waiting , no one turned up, no one even bothered to inform me, they told me it was cancelled because of a problem with my previous provider BT, 6 weeks later an enginner came and installed a new socket and received the router but the openreach enginner told me there is a ""blockage"" in the street which would be fixed in few days and I would have connection but again no one came, no one fixed, still no connection, rang Vodafone many times who seem clueless and don't care, they connected me to agents in North Africa who seemed equally clueless, amazing, if I had known this I would never have joined Vodafone, 2 months later still no connection, vodafone make me wait long time to talk to someone only for that person to make wait ages so he can talk to another person, sometimes they never come back, there is NO customer support or complaint email address, amazing, NO, on top I have heath issues and have to deal with this crap, shame on you Vodafone, waisted so much time for NOTHING.

1,"After over 25 plus years with VF firstly my name then my wife took over account (keeping same number and contract). she was contacted to say changing plan as it was old. The new plan was much worse. Spoke with a VF rep on live chat and was offered very poor deal. Loyalty does not pay I would urge all VF customers to check Uswitch for a fairer deal.UpdateCalled back on the number provided by Social media team. VF rep was nice but useless still the same deal offered so loyalty does not pay. Tried to put us off using an MVNO as it wasn't premium. Then told her of a Uswitch offer with Three . She then proceeded to tell us they weren't that good.......very strange we told her as VF and Three are to merge shortly. After stumbling around a bit we thanked her and the call ended. I suggest all VF customers vote with their feet and leave, as I stated earlier you aren't valued sadly.",Halcyon days,GB,2025-05-23T13:22:57.000Z

1,"‚ÄúFacebook‚Äôs ‚ÄòSupport‚Äô is a Joke ‚Äì No Resolution, Endless Neglect!‚Äù  Despite repeatedly explaining my problem via chat (with an actual human agent!), Facebook has done absolutely nothing to resolve it. I‚Äôve been complaining since yesterday, and instead of action, I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of incompetence. Their own staff said I want be charged but they charged me and now they are still waiting for final bill. Vodafone Stole my money. And there are liers in customer service call. They are made to lie to customer by Vodafone.The So-Called ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù: No urgency: After 24+ hours, they still ask for my name and mobile number‚Äì details I‚Äôve already provided MULTIPLE times.  -Zero progress: Agents acknowledge the complaint but refuse to escalate or fix anything. It‚Äôs like talking to a brick wall.  -Negligence:  My case is clearly being ignored. Their team prioritizes stalling over solving.  Final Thoughts:This isn‚Äôt just bad service ‚Äì it‚Äôs willful neglect. If Facebook can‚Äôt handle basic complaints without stonewalling customers, they shouldn‚Äôt offer ‚Äúsupport‚Äù at all.  Warning to Others: ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid relying on Facebook for anything requiring customer care. You‚Äôll waste hours repeating yourself, only to be ghosted.  To Facebook:Train your team to stop asking for the same info and actually resolve issues. This disrespectful runaround is how you alienate users for good.",Naman Bhandari,GB,2025-05-22T18:32:10.000Z

If I moved to a different Location with my phone, service was normal.To get rid of me, she offered to send replacement Sim cards for the two phones we have. Guess what? No improvement.I am now a Three customer. Voda has utterly lost the plot. I‚Äôm an I.T. Techie myself, and I can tell you the technical reason for the failure was never addressed.

He said he would get my account cancelled and process my complaint and ensure i do not recieve any more payment requests. He even said there would be financial compensation for the extreamly poor customer service i had recieved and all of the difficulties i had trying to resolve the issue.I never recieved a call back and i‚Äôve now had an email requesting the funds again. I‚Äôm now having to call back again, and i‚Äôm on hold to someone else who is investigating the issue for the second time.It‚Äôs simple, i cancelled my service so it ended on the last day i occupied the property.

Over 2 hours of online chat and I still don't know when the phone will arrive.I do know it would take 3 days to cancel the order which hasn't even left. I know that if I'd ordered the phone from Samsung directly I'd already have it.All I want is the phone I ordered to be sent and it seems in a world where I can receive my groceries within an hour , vodafone just can't keep upDissappointed just doesn't cut it.",Fiona Kessell-Holland,GB,2025-05-21T23:29:06.000Z

1,"Used to be the best, now just being bad on purpose I suspect to maintain revenue.I can‚Äôt manage my family‚Äôs phone accounts in one place anymore in preparation for a holiday.The app is designed to frustrate, it used to be good, then it got worse, now it‚Äôs a joke.Basic tasks like logging out, changing spend caps, or managing bolt ons are buried under vague menus or outright blocked or hidden. Want to switch between numbers? Good luck. There‚Äôs no logout button, just a digital hostage situation.Tobi, the so-called chatbot, is less ‚ÄúAI assistant‚Äù and more a geriatric bingo caller throwing random words at your questions.Want to use the support pages? You may as well ask your pet dog to search for the answer.Every update seems designed to remove features, not improve them. The app routinely redirects you to broken web pages, freezes on load, or loops endlessly between logins.This isn‚Äôt a service tool anymore. It‚Äôs a revenue-l preservation device masquerading as an app. Designed to frustrate, And it‚Äôs working, because I‚Äôm finally giving up and changing provider after 20+ years as a Vodafone customer.",Joe Dickson,GB,2025-05-21T20:46:14.000Z

1,Update on Vodafone service. Having waited since January 23 to activate broadband and telephone to the home of a severely disabled elderly lady I can report that the router has been installed in a location that conflicts with published instruction issued by Vodafone. Unable to connect her devices the help of the Vodafone  Bridgwater shop said ‚ÄúVodafone operatives aren‚Äôt insured to enter customers homes‚Äù. As I‚Äôm advised that subcontractors conduct Vodafone installations it surely follows that they too aren‚Äôt insured. Should you have challenging health condition do NOT rely on this company for assistance as you will be disappointed. How then when requested to assist disabled people who need assistance connecting devices do they serve all customers if they aren‚Äôt insured to enter your home? It appears that Vodafone is just a name and all actual work is conducted using subcontractors. Forget this company if you need any assistance due to personal circumstances and or assistance as they aren‚Äôt interested.,Colin,GB,2025-05-21T19:42:19.000Z

1,Getting through to Vodafone is a real pain. it has taken 1 1/2 hours to sort out how to get signed on to my account. Half spent dealing with a useless chat bot and two with a human who couldn't help. When I signed in it sent an SMS to my landline with a signon code which said 'zero minutes'. It turns out they cannot send SMS to a landline so why did they allow me to attach my landline in the first place! The chatbot was useless and the human wasn't much help. after 30 minutes they told me I failed security so had to go to a store. Another wait and it took 20 minutes to get it sorted. Vodafone is another robotic company when if your query doesn't fit with their program you get no where. If I could have e-mailed them I would not have had to hang on.,Richard Wilcock,GB,2025-05-21T19:04:34.000Z

Absolutely disgusting and dishonest. Avoid Vodafone Grantham.Thank you to Vodafone social media team's response inviting me to DM them. How do I do that? No email address, no hashtag, no mobile number to text to. Doesn't look like a serious effort to put right the problem. In addition to all of the above, Vodafone Grantham have initiated a transfer of my Father's old number to Vodafone. So we are about to loose that as well.

1,Broadband not working from 16th May and no one has sorted the issue. Worst customer support. We had to take cabs for work and paying ¬£8 per day for EE wifi Already costed us ¬£90 and maybe it goes on. Worst service ever,Bharath Chand,GB,2025-05-21T12:59:03.000Z

1,"I would give 0 stars if I could! I have had non stop problems with Vodafone. Staff extremely unhelpful and argue back with you. I have a flag on my account because I am autistic and I struggle with my finances and have explained on multiple occasions I need them to be clear and direct with me. Is this ever the case? No. Live chat is completely worthless, takes nearly an hour to get something done every time. As soon as my contract is over, I will be going elsewhere and with my WIFI. The customer service is an absolute joke at this company and they do not care. I have never spoken to someone who hasn‚Äôt got a bad attitude, or who hasn‚Äôt argued back with me. Never spoken to anybody who is kind, compassionate or friendly. Disgusting company",Maddie Porter,GB,2025-05-21T12:47:54.000Z

2,"Process of moving contract and number over to Vodafone was lengthy and confusing. Lots of confusing jargon and missed information. Upon arriving to the store to collect my phone I was informed starling was not accepted which was not confirmed to me prior to the appointment, they then tried to upsell me lots of adds on for data stating that I didn‚Äôt have enough when I know full well that I have enough. When my number and contract were finally set up I was automatically subscribed to lots of extra add ons which I had to manually cancel but I find this a bit sleazy as it could easily be missed and recurring charges would be made. Not really too pleased and may be moving to another provider next time.",Eddie Hernandes,GB,2025-05-21T12:14:37.000Z

1,"I wanted to move my number to Vodafone. I went to a store, everything went well, and the porting was scheduled for the 19th of May. However, it wasn‚Äôt completed on time, nor two days later. I used the online chat service to ask why it wasn‚Äôt finished, but none of the agents could resolve the issue. They suggested I call another number, but I didn‚Äôt have time. The last agent then rescheduled another porting request for tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt think that will happen either. This is my second time trying to port my number in the UK, and both times have been disasters. And, because of this delay, I will be overcharged for using the other carrier without a plan.",Cenk,GB,2025-05-21T10:56:07.000Z

I explained that the bill was due on 21st May so why were they even badgering me but agent said no its due the 20th, i have bill saying 21st and text saying 21st but then asked to send them the proof the agent even tried to sell me something when i am trying to solve the issue, ended up ending the call because they were not interested in solving the issue. I always pay on time yet this month they worried they wont get their money, would i recommend nope not after the frustrating chat experience and guess what went on to my account and there it was you have paid your bill, an hour of my life i will never get back!",jane little,GB,2025-05-20T18:33:00.000Z

I returned a phone I had never even used and they charged me for 10 days line rental and then during the time I was challenging this they charged ¬£5 late payment fee.

1,"FTTP Broadband from Vodafone:I've just had a truly dreadful experience with Vodafone and thought I would warn others.My 1.6Gbps FTTP service was installed yesterday at the second attempt (8 days after it should have been). The service worked at the advertised speeds getting 1.6Gbps during the day and being throttled to their 'guaranteed minimum' 800Mbps later in the evening and through midnight and beyond.The issue is that the supplied Ultra Hub only has 1 x 2.5Gbps port (which is used for the ONT incoming fibre connection) and 4 x 1Gbps ports which obviously can't supply the 1.6Gbps I paid for to my wired 10Gbps intranet and BE85 WiFi7 mesh system.As I'm only on day 2 of the 'cooling off period' I tried to get Vodafone to simply swap the Router for the one they now include in the exact same 1.6Gbps package. Should have been easy, Right? Wrong! Chat to AI bot and then Agent last night got me nothing except 'call a number tomorrow'. I did. The first agent at least tried to be helpful but couldn't do what was needed. The second agent in termination/retentions frankly couldn't give a damn so I simply terminated the contract.I've now ordered a 1.6Gbps service from EE (who also guarantee a minimum 1.3Gbps which is much better than Vodafone's 800 minimum!).I only need a Hub that works and feeds into my existing intranet so customer service should not be needed (I've heard that EE aren't great either).I would now have to suggest very strongly that people avoid Vodafone based on my experience (as a pre-existing broadband user). I didn't have any problems with them before, but they failed me with what should have been a very simple replacement task.Obviously this speed issue only applies to plans above 1 Gbps, but I would also add that it was impossible to get the supplied WiFi Extender to pair, and I'm a computer geek having worked in the industry all my life. The pairing issue is apparently very common. Caveat Emptor!Edit: I reached out to Vodafone via Facebook messaging as requested in their response, went through the exact same process I'd previously already gone through 3 times today, and eventually got told to phone another landline number for an IMMEDIATE disconnect! I had requested Saturday midnight. Talk about adding insult to injury. I can only think they are trying to force me beyond the 14 day no cancellation fee deadline.Please note right here that I tried to cancel this 4 times today May 20th 2025 and I expect that request to be honored and no early termination fee charged!I was also unable to raise a formal complaint, but told the details for that were on their website!",Colin Dyckes,GB,2025-05-20T17:21:05.000Z

It‚Äôs an issue that had the multiple advisors I‚Äôve contacted actually listened, would have been fixed in 2 weeks at worst.As it stands after Openreach (who have been excellent) repaired the cable that had been cut during gas pipe replacement in my area, and leaving me just needing to have the cable reconnecting to my property. I have been unable to get Vodafone to arrange for this to happen. Because they have kept charging me! You get about ¬£9 a day compensation, so I am actually in credit by over ¬£500 currently.

That went as well as you can imagine.Upshot is when I move in the next few months, I will make it clear that the new occupant should choose Virgin or BT, cheap is cheap for a reason.Per the response, I gave you a rare second chance, I never give a third.",Karen Jones,GB,2025-05-19T18:48:31.000Z

1,"Zero is not available unfortunately. I have never had such a shockingly bad customer experience. I transferred my service to Vodafone broadband from Virgin Media in April. When it transferred I contacted Virgin to enquire about returning my equipment and was told my service hadn't been cancelled with them by Vodafone. Vodafone initially claimed that they couldn't tell Virgin even though they can tell other providers. Virgin claim this is totally incorrect. They blamed one another at this point. I spent many hours on phone and chat with both companies dealing with this and eventually was assured by Vodafone that they would cover the almost 7 weeks of charges from Virgin as I had to take on a cancellation period before disconnection. When I finally got my closing bill from Virgin I contacted Vodafone via chat as agreed by the agent who said they would cover my losses. Eventually I had to switch to a phone call after I had been cut off from chat 3 times. When I got through on the phone the agent disputed that they had agreed to pay the accrued costs even though I had it screenshotted and he could see it on my account. I then was caught in a hellscape of trying to a) get them to understand that it is not my problem if their colleague has given out the wrong information and b) once he acknowledged that they should honour their word, trying to upload my final bill via a simultaneous chat as they don't do email?!!! I began this interaction at 11.30 am and as I type  at 3.23pm I am not yet done. Interspersed with some human comments are the inevitable AI generated generic comments which are beyond annoying. Oh, and at one point the agent asked me to have some patience and 'Wait!' said in what can only be described as an exasperated fashion. He also at one point offered me and then withdrew the offer of a ¬£10 voucher as I am not a mobile customer! Surely you can do better than this Vodafone. I am sorely disappointed that I am now contracted to you for 18 months as frankly you don't deserve the business.",conradv,GB,2025-05-19T17:31:24.000Z

1,"19/05 - Dear Vodafone Customer Service,I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I have been receiving since switching to Vodafone.Ten days ago, I transferred from Virgin to Vodafone due to Virgin‚Äôs inability to provide internet services for 17 days. Unfortunately, my experience with Vodafone has not been any better, as I have already encountered four outages in the past ten days.I have contacted your customer service five times, and the resolution offered has been inadequate, with the issue being attributed to CityFibre. While I understand that Vodafone uses CityFibre's network, my contract is with Vodafone, and I expect Vodafone to address and resolve these service disruptions promptly.The frequent outages have significantly impacted my daily activities and work, and I am seeking immediate action to rectify this situation. I would appreciate it if you could:Provide a clear explanation of the cause of these repeated outages.Offer a timeline for resolution.Compensate for the inconvenience suffered due to lack of consistent services.I have been paying Vodafone for reliable internet service, and I expect Vodafone to take responsibility for ensuring its provision, regardless of the third-party networks involved.Please treat this matter with urgency and let me know how you intend to resolve these issues.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely,19/05 7 hours latter Update: contacted the team as requested not only they gave the same responses as I had before but I wasted another 3 hours explaining everything over again! So it‚Äôs even worse than before20/05 NEW UPDATE - 30 hours and couting with no resolution and no internet. Vodafone are not willing to let me out of the contract withou paying Early Exit Fee but also is not giving me a sulution to my problem.",Danilo Busseni,GB,2025-05-20T11:19:12.000Z

1,"I received an email nearly a week ago out of the blue telling me that I owed Vodafone money for equipment. I.e. an iPhone I purchased when I was a Vodafone broadband/mobile customer which I had been paying for and it turned out that I had accidentally cancelled the DD so I immediately tried to contact Vodafone by email asking them for details so I could either pay off any remaining balance in full or reset the DD. I since emailed them twice but absolutely no response! In the meantime I have received two threatening emails that unless I contacted they would pass it to a collection company. With that comes the problem with my credit reference file but clearly Vodafone don‚Äôt care! So Vodafone why the threatening emails? This could all have been resolved within minutes and the DD reset or the balance paid off but clearly you would rather make my life more difficult instead. Do your homework first about this company before using them as a supplier. 1600. 19.05,2025.  So Vodafone you are sorry for the experiences I have had from your company. So why are you not able to ‚Äúreach out‚Äù to me as you say I can?

1,"Ordered broadband.  Couldn't fit due to rat chewing the fibre in a post. Fair enough so waited for it to be fixed got told 31st, then 3rd then 7th then 13th then 28th of May. Fair enough open reach could just do the work but reality is vodaphone just kept telling me the wrong dates for it to be fixed. I'm an ex telecoms engineer so I know the pole just needed capping at the top and a splice in the post... Hour work easy. Instead they are trying to request permission to change the whole post which means planning permission which takes months. I thought well give it time I get the ¬£6 compo / day. It'll be practically be free when doneHowever, then some smarty pants from vodaphone starts calling in the day, kindly told them I'm working nights, need to sleep call me back later I need sleep. Guy ignores this keeps yapping. I hung up then decided I'll just keep ringing even when I've picked the phone up I'm getting more calls from vodaphone.Now I've cancelled my broadband order and I'm going to cancel both mobile contracts next.Congrats. Maybe next time you'll let a man sleep. Not too sure why it asks for a location for Vodafone in York or Aberdeen when filling this in cause the issue was clearly in India.",Tommy Lea,GB,2025-05-19T12:34:22.000Z
1,"I genuinely regret choosing Vodafone for both my broadband and mobile phone contract. I was sold their premium ""Pro II Broadband"" package on the promise of easy setup and expert support. None of it was delivered.The broadband never linked to my account, despite following every instruction. I tried to call for help ‚Äî only to discover that it‚Äôs not even possible to speak to a human being. I was forced to use a chatbot, which got me nowhere. Repeated requests for a callback were refused or ignored. Eventually, I was promised a call within the hour, and then a manager would follow up within 7 days. It‚Äôs now well past that, no one has ever called back.On top of that, I took out the mobile plan as part of a bundle which included a trade-in discount. I honestly described the phone, sent it in, and later received a vague text saying it was ""not as described"" ‚Äî with no explanation and the discount seemingly withdrawn.Most upsetting of all, I told Vodafone at the point of purchase that I had recently undergone brain surgery, and asked that communication be made slowly, verbally, and followed up in writing. I was assured this would be no problem. Instead, I have been fobbed off by automated systems, and nobody at Vodafone has made the slightest effort to respect the reasonable adjustments I requested, which they are legally required to make under the Equality Act.I‚Äôve sent multiple formal complaints, all ignored. No resolution. No apology. No service.This has been exhausting and completely unacceptable. I‚Äôm now escalating to CISAS (Vodafone‚Äôs dispute resolution scheme), but the time and energy this has cost me is not something I will soon forget.Avoid Vodafone at all costs, and if you do choose them, pray you never need support.PS Don't believe me, go look at any Facebook post and you will see a list of very unhappy customers trying to seek a resolution through other means, because they don't care about service!",Matthew MacDonald,GB,2025-05-19T12:33:41.000Z

1,"Edit*** after spending 4 hours trying to contact Vodafone on both the number provided and the social media chat- as said in Vodafones response to this review. Nothing has been resolved and they just keep advising us to call the same number while still holding the phone. Once again, poor customer service from Zidane and Khushboo who said they didnt know how to help, other than for me to pay ¬£750. STAY AWAY from this company. I have been a loyal vodafone customer for over 20 years. I bought a phone with vodafone that is still in warranty. The sim card reader stopped working. They tried to give me a virtual sim, which didnt work. Then when sending it to them they quoted me ¬£750 to repair for a phone i can buy brand new for ¬£300. I then questioned the person on the phone and he laughed and ended the phone on me. I pay for 4 phones and will never pay a penny to vodafone again. Stay far away from this company, no loyalty to customers whatsoever. Its clear why they have a 1 star review, go to EE or O2 and stay away from this backstabbing company. I am taking business far away from them.",Tamzin,GB,2025-05-19T20:22:10.000Z

I contacted Vodafone who advised the sale/connection was not completed their end and would take a further 3-5 business days to complete - after a whole month since the order date! Spoke with Vodafone (via the tortuous TOBI chat) today,19th May, to ask for activation status after their initial reply below and they advised me to wait until 27th May before checking for progress!? Vodafone account cancelled!Vodafone still haunts me! Cancellation glitch prevented cancellation with fibre provider CityFibre which prevents my new ISP from activating me until 4th June!

1,"Once I arrived in the UK for the first time, they convinced me to sign a 2-year contract with a monthly fee of 12.5 ¬£ for the first 6 months. However, I was naive and didn't notice that it was a marketing trap. Now, my wife and I are paying 63 ¬£ monthly for just 2 lines, and they are not accepting any cancellations or even changing plans with fewer data. My wife contacted them multiple times and explained to them she couldn't find a job and couldn't afford the bill, but they threatened her that if you don't pay the bill, it would be bad for your credit. They are not showing any flexibility. Be careful, don't trust any long-term contract with operators, especially Vodafone.",arash mortezapour,GB,2025-05-18T23:56:27.000Z
5,I was having trouble with coverage on my previous network so I called into the Vodafone shop in Ards shopping centre. I had a chat with the manager and he recommended their Voxi Sim as I am only a Pay as you go customer. He helped me obtain my PAC code so that I could keep my old number and set the whole thing up for me. I am amazed by the improvement in coverage compared to previous provider. I run a small business and attend events where I accept card payments but this only works when I have good mobile data coverage - I was losing sales before I switched to Vodafone.

5,Since being with Vodafone from November 2024 I have had quite some difficulty phoning Vodafone and getting things sorted so I can use it. I did end up losing my sim card back in Jan 2025 and then later ordered which they said would take 3-5 working days to arrive. But didn't. Had debt collectors on me to for a SIM card I don't even use and still have to pay for. Today I tried to activate my SIM card to use for my WiFi and was told from the first colleague it has been inactive since 15th April. Shocking that no one told me. But was past over to a lovely lady called Savera who helped me get rid of my old SIM number and get a new one. The 1hr and 31 mins of that phone was so helpful. She has been the most helpful one since being with Vodafone from end of 2024. She explained everything thoroughly for me and my partner and helped order and new one which hopefully should arrive tomorrow ‚ò∫Ô∏è We need a lot more people like Savera. :) (Give her a raise or praise at least please),Ryder Hunt,GB,2025-05-18T13:37:24.000Z

It could have taken 72 hours with no mobile phone, but it had to be done! It actually took around 2 hours and my phone was receiving texts and calls were clear and no longer cutting connection or going dumb.A previous 'network issue' had been solved but my phone number was 'forgotten' by the machine.

1,"I went 128 days without broadband after moving house, despite Vodafone promising installation by the end of December. I was repeatedly given conflicting information, had to chase updates myself, and was even told my order had been cancelled without my consent.After two months of waiting, I was given a temporary WiFi dongle. The signal was poor due to my location, but I was told I wouldn‚Äôt be charged for it and would be refunded any fees. I‚Äôve now been charged ¬£77 for it, and when I tried to claim this back, Vodafone said they couldn‚Äôt find any record of that promise ‚Äì so I‚Äôm out of pocket on top of everything else.No one seemed to take ownership, and each time I contacted them, I had to start from scratch with a new adviser. I had to take time off work for missed appointments and even went into a store just to try and get answers.The delay was apparently due to Openreach needing to carry out work, but Vodafone didn‚Äôt manage this properly or communicate clearly. I finally got connected in May ‚Äì nearly four and a half months later ‚Äì but only after a long and stressful battle.Would not recommend if you‚Äôre relying on them for a time-sensitive move or expect to be treated fairly.",Hannah,GB,2025-05-17T12:24:08.000Z

1,"I‚Äôve had a number of issues with Vodaphone since joining. Really slow Internet connection being the main issue. In April we lost all internet connection and spoke with someone who managed to fix the issue after 24 hours. Then we lost internet connection on another 3/4 occasions which took over 48 hours to fix and hundreds of conversations later just telling us to turn the power off, reset the box etc etc We asked on so many occasions for them to send an engineer out to fix the issue which they refused to do despite having no internet for days on end. Eventually we managed to get one sent out but that came with its own issues. Cancelling appointments, not turning up etc. when they did eventually come out it turns out everything was installed poorly and no wonder we kept losing internet connection. Fixed the issue and when I spoke to Vodaphone they tried telling me we are entitled to about ¬£9 compensation‚Ä¶ what a joke!!! After arguing to multiple people and getting the same results we have managed to get our April bill payment back (which would be applied  as a credit to use towards next bill) but guess what we haven‚Äôt even had that!!!!!!!

They would easily be able to see the phone number had not been used but carried on charging me over ¬£67 for every ongoing month for a phone number that they could see had NO USAGE & hadn't even been upgraded for donkeys years WITHOUT any notifications, although they said they wrote I never received anything. They kept me on the phone being passed from person to person for over an hour & a quarter. They wouldn't even allow me to settle in full & told me Ill gave to call back in June to pay another final bill as they cant predict what the bill will be, even though it will be the flat rate and not in use!

1,"Vodafone UK has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Since 14:00 today (and it‚Äôs now 21:45), I have been in contact with about 10 different Vodafone UK customer service representatives, both on the phone and via chat, and none of them has been able to help me.The simple issue is that no one can reach my number by phone ‚Äî no one is able to call me ‚Äî and nobody has been able to resolve or assist with this. When I was finally able to log into my Vodafone UK account (which was also a big hassle), I tried to upgrade my plan, hoping that might fix the issue of not being reachable. But when I attempted to upgrade, the message said: ""This number is not able to upgrade"" and ""Can't upgrade with this number.""None of the representatives could help me. Some of them even hung up on me for no reason, probably because the issue was too challenging to solve.On top of that, all of your services ‚Äî the website, chat, and app ‚Äî have major issues. It‚Äôs never clear if they‚Äôre working properly. For someone to suddenly become unreachable feels like a horror movie.All that was left was to get a PAC code, transfer my number to a different provider, and finally get the hell away from them.Never again, Vodafone UK.Best.",Emilia,CH,2025-05-15T22:06:57.000Z

1,"Appalling Administration / Customer Service All ok until I tried to renew my contract. My engineer appointment was cancelled but I only discovered this a few days before, when I tried to find out why I'd had no confirmation. 3 MONTHS later, 1) I am out of contract, paying more for my broadband than I was quoted for an UPgraded service2) I am locked out of my account - neither my log in, or mobile number are 'recognised', despite a message being sent to this number every month3) I have wasted countless hours and suffered immense frustration at the dreadful AI / customer care teams who quote from a script with no understanding or means to do anything + a few advisors who were very helpful and assured me everything would be resolved but nothing actually happened. 4) A formal complaint has achieved nothing, yet I was asked today, for permission to close it.Update - the reply proves my point. I'd put my order number but I'm asked to contact facebook team to repeat everything I've already said by phone, email, chat and now an external review.

1,"I bought a phone with a case. The case was not available, despite what the salesperson said over the phone. Another salesperson lied that it had ‚Äújust been delivered‚Äù and claimed we couldn‚Äôt cancel that part of the order. Then someone else said they never received it in the first place, only to later promise they would cancel it‚Äîwhich was also a lie. I was strung along repeatedly. Completely unprofessional and disorganized. Horrible experience.Now, while I‚Äôm away from home for an extended period, they suddenly decide to send the case I‚Äôve asked to cancel multiple times. Of course, because I‚Äôm not home, it will be returned. My contract is new, but the second it ends, I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôd rather have no phone at all than be stuck with this company. Avoid at all costs. Of course never got the money back.",Robert Kabat,GB,2025-05-15T16:04:50.000Z

1,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start with how terrible Vodafone‚Äôs service has been ‚Äì both in-store and over the phone. I was pre-approved for two contracts, even though I only needed one. The store staff were completely unhelpful, uninterested, and ignored me throughout the process. I ordered an iPhone 16 Pro and a Microsoft Surface Pro laptop. They gave me the phone in-store and said the laptop would be delivered.On the delivery day, I was at home the entire time. The DPD driver didn‚Äôt even knock ‚Äì instead, they marked it as ‚Äúincorrect pin‚Äù . When I called Vodafone to get it redelivered, they pushed me to DPD. DPD said they can‚Äôt redeliver and that it‚Äôs going back to the warehouse.So who do I believe? DPD says it‚Äôs still in transit. Vodafone says it‚Äôs already out of stock. Then Vodafone says, ‚ÄúSince you passed the credit check, we‚Äôll give you another device.‚Äù I waited for laptop to get restocked. Then later after months I asked for a Samsung Fold phone instead ‚Äî now suddenly I‚Äôm not eligible anymore? Why pre-approve two contracts and promise a replacement if that‚Äôs not true?And here‚Äôs the real problem ‚Äî Vodafone just tells you anything to get you off the line. They give you completely false information. Every agent has a different story. One says a complaint has been raised. Another says no record of any complaint. One says I won‚Äôt be charged. Another says I owe a payment. It‚Äôs all lies just to make you stop calling. No one takes responsibility.To top it off, I paid ¬£100 upfront for the laptop. They said the contract was cancelled and I wouldn‚Äôt be charged. But I was charged for one month and received payment reminder messages. It took TWO MONTHS and constant follow-ups just to get my upfront fee refunded. And that only happened because I kept chasing them ‚Äî not because Vodafone did their job.Vodafone, your customer service is beyond disgraceful. You treat customers with zero respect. This has been the most frustrating experience I‚Äôve ever had with any company. I‚Äôll never use Vodafone again, and I would strongly advise anyone reading this: don‚Äôt fall for their lies. They‚Äôll promise you everything and deliver nothing",B.Prashanthi Reddy,GB,2025-05-15T14:45:36.000Z

1,"I have been a customer with Vodafone for over 20 yrs for my mobile phone and still am , have also been with their home broadband for 7 years , there have been issues but generally ok , the call centres can be problematic due to language barriers , as they are all based abroad in either Egypt or India , they try but often not easy due to accents etc .Today I have terminated my new contract for full fibre broadband due to the atrocious mix up , they told me they would price match any other advertised deal available ( in my case Gigaclear offering 500mbps for 24 a month ) as I have my mobile with them I get a Vodafone together discount of ¬£2 plus the max discount they could offer is ¬£9 ‚Ä¶which brought it down to ¬£33 ‚Ä¶they then said they would credit my account for the remaining amount to bring it down to ¬£24 a month ‚Ä¶however this was all done VERBALLY and when the contract arrived I was being charged ¬£33 which isn‚Äôt what was agreed . ‚Ä¶bearing in mind I spent a whole hour on the phone dealing with this . I was promised a call back which never happened , so have no cancelled which is a shame as I prefer to stay with the same company and avoid the hassle of moving ‚Ä¶but I am now signing up with Gigaclear ‚Ä¶so bye bye Vodafone , you‚Äôve lost a good customer ‚Ä¶and when my mobile phone contract runs out in September I shall go with another company .

My daughter decided on what she wanted and we agreed to purchase a contract. I then spoke about getting an additional number and handset and this was sorted with the same efficiency and courtesy as the first enquiry. After hearing what was offered, I also purchased another contract. My other daughter also enquired about broadband and a new iPad and again, this was handled exactly the same way. We went in for 1 phone upgrade and left with 1 upgrade, 1 additional phone, 1 broadband deal and an iPad. We were in the store for nearly 2hrs but everything went very smoothly with 0 issues. Matty even took time to try and keep my young granddaughter entertained as she was understandably getting bored.

2,"Be aware before going with Vodafone Broadband. They do not have their own installer team. They use CityFibre. See my review on that company!At no stage am did I know that they didn‚Äôt use their own people. If you buy the installation will NOT be a complete installation and explanation of what you have or how to set it up. It‚Äôs how fast can we get out of the property and go for a beer!! I hope the service is better than the installation, but if the installation and help is anything to go by‚Ä¶..I might have made a huge mistake!!I will review the service in 6 months which is a fair trial!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!",Tony Horsley,GB,2025-05-14T20:06:37.000Z

1,Absolutely atrocious service! My wife's parents moved home and their router hasn't worked properly since. I work in I.T. and know it's clearly the router because it's dropping out once you go beyond 5 meters. The hub is 7 years old so due to be replaced. They recently signed up for a new contract and were told to use the existing hub. My sister in law spent two hours on the phone asking them to send a replacement hub and they flat out refused because their remote checks say it's working. Tried to up sell to a different package instead of actually fixing the problem. Personally I would avoid completely,Lee,GB,2025-05-14T19:48:55.000Z
1,"it is unreliable and unstable broadband connection. It has been a year with Vodafone and when I reported the first issue, manager on the shift was arrogant by not even accept to speak to me. They will just pass information through their agents who discuss the issue on your behalf, as if the manager does not want to speak to customers. what a shameful behaviour.

5,"I don't usually leave reviews, but the service I received at Vodafone in Ashton was genuinely exceptional and deserves recognition.From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and made to feel like a valued customer. The star of the show? Viken ‚Äì hands down the best member of staff I‚Äôve ever encountered in any mobile store. His knowledge, patience, and professionalism were second to none. He took the time to understand exactly what I needed, explained all the options clearly, and never once made me feel rushed or pressured.Viken went above and beyond to make sure I left with the best deal for my needs. He even helped transfer everything over from my old phone and made sure everything was working perfectly before I left. Nothing was too much trouble.In an age where good customer service is becoming rare, Viken is a breath of fresh air. Vodafone Ashton ‚Äì you‚Äôve got a gem on your team.

1,"I‚Äôve had a terrible experience with Vodafone. I called on 29 April to relocate my broadband service to my new flat. The agent told me it would be set up by 6 May, which felt like a long wait, but I accepted it. As the date approached, I was notified that the installation had been rescheduled to 9 May. I took a day off work to accommodate this.On 9 May, the technician arrived but was unable to complete the job due to missing tools, and I was told it would be rescheduled again to 13 May. I reluctantly agreed, as I urgently need the internet.On 13 May, I took another day off and waited the whole day for the technician. I then received a notification saying I had been ""missed"" ‚Äî despite being home all day and available. I tried to call, but there was no contact number provided, and I received no prior communication to confirm the technician‚Äôs arrival.This is extremely frustrating and unprofessional. After all these delays and poor service, I‚Äôve decided to cancel my Vodafone account and will be switching to a more reliable provider.I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on my experience.",Joy Remo,GB,2025-05-14T15:54:15.000Z

1,"Rubbish service. Words fail me.1) Website crashed when I chose the 'Add plan' option to try to see my option to buy a SIM-only plan with an 'exclusive discount. Gave up trying and went over to the chat;2) After slogging through the time-wasting chatbot options I eventually got to chatting with a human being. Agent just went into listing what she wanted to sell me instead of listening to my requirements. Gave up on the chat;3) Got a phone call from the same agent to try and salvage the situation. Got a very bad VoIP line from India (agent had very heavy Indian accent). The bad line and heavy accent made it nearly impossible  but eventually I got a SIM-only deal for ¬£8.33+VAT / month for 18 months. It had taken 2 failed attempts and an hour of my time so far;4) Next day got a 'Welcome' email saying the contract was for ¬£20+VAT per month. Called Vodafone to get a correction. Got an agent with a really heavy Eastern European accent who just told me I had 3 options - cancel the contract and restart with a new price, wait until next billing cycle to sort it out, and another irrelevant option. Had to argue really hard that Vodafone had already agreed to the ¬£8.33+VAT and it was their job to confirm the correct price by checking their audit trail - it was not my job to fix their quality control problems;4) Agent mentioned a ¬£14 discount, then it clicked that the original welcome email had bad HTML in it that rendered the '¬£' sign as something out of a Space Invaders game so the info about the discount was just gobbledygook but also buried as an after-thought at the bottom of the message. More to the point they should have stated clearly what I am paying and not the price before discount. Simple. Another 30 mins. wasted;Vodafone are a basket case.- website doesn't work;- webchat is a time-waster with agents badly trained;- atrocious overseas voice connections to call-centre agents;- use of call-centre agents with unacceptable English skills;- failure to check outbound emails for accuracy and legibility;- agents are programmed to provide the responses that Vodafone want to give instead of what the customer needs as though we exist for their benefit;",Stephen Farndon,GB,2025-05-14T14:31:44.000Z

1,I opened a Broadband Account in December 2024 but decided that I didn't want to proceed with it and cancelled with Vodafone within the 14 day cooling off period.  Even though I received the router I never opened the box or used the service.  There is a Vodafone store where I live so I returned the equipment and was told the account was closed.. WRONG.In January I received a missed payment letter.  I called Vodafone and they said it was an error and not to worry they will close the account. I then received a missed payment letter in February.  I went back to the store (when I called the Call centre they could not access the account) and they agreed the account should be closed and again told me it had been sorted out. I then received a credit report which was showing missed payments thus affecting my credit score. When I disputed these so-called missing payments these were showing as cleared but now I have April and May showing as missed.  How can anyone trust Vodafone to provide a decent service when they cannot get a simple matter of closing an account right!,Fenton Bowley,GB,2025-05-14T12:16:01.000Z

1,"Did the mistake to book broadband service with Vodafone. The most incompetent company EVER. I book the service since April to be activated on 13th of May. On 28th of April I received a text message saying that no engineer visit is need and I just have to plug in the equipment on the day. On the 13th while I was at work I received a call from an openreach engineer saying that I had a booking. Obv as I was not inform there was no one in to open him. Ofc the broadband never gone live on the day, with me spending hours in online chat and calls to see if the can resolve the issue. The outcome was that I have to wait another 2 days with NO INTERNET and call again after 2 days to book a new engineer appointment. JUST BECAUSE VODAFONE thought that it will be good idea not to inform me that an engineer will have to visit.",Panayiotis Panteli,US,2025-05-14T11:00:33.000Z

1,"I received a letter through the post saying 900Meg broadband was now available in my area and i can switch now. The price was super attractive and they said they would handle everything, contact my current provider and pay upto ¬£100 to cover the switch cost. So i thought great and signed up. A week later i get a call to say the order is cancelled and spend over an hour on the phone to find out they cant provide fibre in my area. They have already contact my current provider and cancelled my current subscription for me and now i will have no internet for  a period of time. I work from home full time and cant work without internet. This is terrible service, not only will i have no internet for a week+ but i have also wasted over an hour on the phone to these clowns.Avoid at all cost, they are cheap for a reason, They are terrible!",Daniel Pickett,GB,2025-05-14T10:22:35.000Z

1,Bought a phone on Saturday was told it would switch from O2 on Tuesday. got a mail from Vodafone at 1300 sawing switch had happened but phone dead.  Went back to Marlborough store at 1700. After an hour of messing about store manager assured me it would be sorted at midnight. Gave me a ¬£10 sim so I would not be without a phone as I had been asked to erase old one. ¬£10 sim did not work! As of 0800 still no working phone.  Empty promises and shocking customer serviceEdited. Been asked by Vodafone to call them. How stupid! I DO NT HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!,Simon Tillling,GB,2025-05-14T09:50:37.000Z
1,Vodafone has serious network problems in multiple locations.  Experiencing mobile data speeds on my iPhone 14 of 0.88 Mbps download and 0.30 Mbps upload - EE speeds where I am are 136 Mbps download on the same device and Vodafone are being cheeky saying it‚Äôs my phone that‚Äôs broken and not their terrible network. Had to cancel the wife‚Äôs sim as a second line as she had the same problem (within 14 days cooling off period). Problem at multiple locations over a wide area.  Vodafone seem to have had no 4G Coverage (and they won‚Äôt deploy it and same for 5G in some areas) and what‚Äôs been happening is the phones have been using 3G which is in the process of being turned off.  If it‚Äôs not a very busy area there‚Äôs no 5G so you receive the lowest possible speeds less than 1 Mbps (less than 128 kilobyte download speeds)Phone swaps between 1 bar and network unavailable at times where as I have a good signal on the second sim with EE (business use only).  No matter how much I complain to Vodafone they don‚Äôt want to help and they repeatedly ask me to do various things to reset network settings even though it‚Äôs their awful network. EDIT; they don‚Äôt care. Broadband is the wrong team.  I‚Äôve already asked for it to be raised as a complaint but they‚Äôve not done so please sort this out.  It‚Äôs horrendous the problems I‚Äôm facing its data speed it‚Äôs noise on the line and problems sending text messages because of the very weak signal where I live.  There‚Äôs also problems at multiple addresses /locations even far from home.,Ben,GB,2025-05-14T09:04:39.000Z

1,"Internet connection is actually diabolical with being bellow guaranteed minimum speeds 40 odd days now since signing up to them, barely ever works on my games consoles and the price is way to high for the service actually getting as I have constant issues with Internet being barely 1Mbps. Lets get on about there customer service.. its actually a joke being run round and round in circles with the same test and the same questions over and over blaming everything but them selves. Was even told that I was only going to get 100mbps with the cable being used from the box in the wall and told me the 'speed i was getting' was 102mbps when actually I was getting 750mpbs so was straight out lied to. I've had better Internet on dial up! Stay away from vodafones apparent full fiber. Its full crap!!! I will be changing with immediate effect as they have now breached contract with 36 registered speed tests being under minimum guaranteed and nothing being done about it after constantly complaints and requesting an engineer visit. Would not even recommend you if you were the last ISP on earth!!",Stuart Nunn,GB,2025-05-13T20:51:12.000Z
1,"Initially requested an upgrade to full fibre 3 months ago, was given an installation date and then nothing happened. When I contacted them they said their operative had cancelled it (no warning given). SO went thru the process again, was eventually fitted (after several weeks, road and garden being dug up by openreach and finally fibre installed by another sub-contractor).Never received a new 'powerhub' as promised. Now their is good wifi speed but only within a few feet of the old router. Contacted them to explain and request a replacement and after over an hour of pointless checks, tests and hanging around waiting for their operative to reply have been fobbed off with the 'everything is fine, there is no problem' routine. Abysmal customer service. Now I have the joy of trying to get through to them on the phone to cancel the contract.Vodafone - simply not worth the hassle!",Krishna,GB,2025-05-13T20:33:11.000Z

1,"We have used Vodafone home broadband since October 2024 and have always had a cut-off issue a couple of times per day. I lost track of how many times I called customer service about this. The support guys were great. Always did their best to help, but nothing has changed. 1 day good, the day after very poor connection. I begged them to change the device, maybe it is faulty, or send an engineer to check, but they said the line seems okay, and they cannot do that. My husband and I work from home and today we could not complete our tasks and missed our SLAs! onlye because of the bad internet connection. Congratulations, Vodafone, and thank you for not helping me with this situation. This is your fault, your connection issue, and you asked me to pay the early cancellation fee of around ¬£300 instead of having a professional conversation from custoemr success. I am just told a formal complaint form has been raised and you will reach me out. I will not be your customer from the 15th, and because you see it on your system, you probably will reach out on the 16th and say "" there is nothing you can do because I cancelled my contract"" I know this scenario. Huuuugeee disappointment. You always had bad network connections check how many times i reached you out. You never manage to fix it permanately and in the end you forced me to pay early termination fee. I terminated my contract with you today due to poor connections, which is your responsibility, and I received an email that you said that an estimated ¬£300 something will be added to my final bill. Speechless! I will also change my mobile contract, but unfortunately, I need to wait until the end because otherwise, you will charge me for another ¬£300. Never say never, but NEVER get your broadband ( City fibre) I mentally felt down, spent hours on the phone, missed my SLAs and now I need to work more to close the gap instead of spending time with my child. Thank you for that! Well done. Just pay a bit more and go with more pro home broadband brands. They do not care who you are or how struggle you are.",Ozge Chassang,GB,2025-05-13T17:44:11.000Z

1,"For broadband- we booked our move to take Vodafone with us to our new property on 11th March (moving date of 31st March). They came out to us on the 2nd April to fit the connection but was unable to do so due to external works needing to be completed. They said someone would be back out within 2-5 working days. After weeks of chasing and a lot of stress (whilst being heavily pregnant) they eventually came back out to do the external work on 7th May (over a month later). The connection still didn‚Äôt go live so we were told an engineer would come out and it would be live by midnight on 9th May. We are now on the 13th May and were promised a technician out today between 8am- 1pm. They haven‚Äôt turned up. For context, they are aware I‚Äôm over 37 weeks pregnant and don‚Äôt have any access to internet or signal meaning I am unable to contact anyone in an emergency. We are paying ¬£25 a month for a 5G dongle to try and get some form of internet through Vodafone which also doesn‚Äôt work and they‚Äôve not once offered to pay to compensate this. Due to working from home, I have had to fund and organise alternative travel and working arrangements for the last month and a half. Today they are still telling us they don‚Äôt know when the technician will be out and that it could be tomorrow or longer. I have been promised call backs from managers and they haven‚Äôt called. I have had to call to chase every few days. Do not trust if they tell you someone will call you or be out to your property as it doesn‚Äôt go ahead. The stress of this is causing me to be seriously unwell. They are a shocking company with no organisation or ability to talk successfully between teams. Do not trust what they say as we have been told so many lies since the start of April. As soon as we receive the compensation owed we will be changing provider. We‚Äôve only been with them since the start of the year and haven‚Äôt had internet for half the time. Will be going back to Sky.",Gabriella Reynolds,GB,2025-05-13T14:16:18.000Z

1,"We have recently changed to Vodaphone for our broadband and the service has been absolutely shocking. The hub was installed 6 days ago and we still have no internet or phone. Staff on the helplines seem to be genuinely trying to help but just keep telling us to restart the router and then say we need to wait another 72 or 48 hours. Nobody can tell us what we are waiting for. One person told us we need a new hub but he is unable to order one, we have to wait another few days first. We have spent hours in the phone to them with no success. They can‚Äôt do anything to help, they can‚Äôt provide a service but they can of course send a bill! So disappointing.",Ali J,GB,2025-05-13T08:06:53.000Z
2,"Vodafone failed to provide a complete service. I have had to open several support requests for the same issue, which remains unsolved to date.

1,I have been struggling for a couple of weeks with VF as my mobile contract is ending. Its appears a VF contract coming to an end is not as clear as it seems.  Chat is terminated abruptly after hours trying to get a clear answer from them. Today my VF mobile number was cancelled ( not on my instructions ) and so was the PAC to transfer to a new provider even tho it was good until the 28 May and I used it on Friday 9 May. No i have no mobile with VF or Lebara. VF claim i asked for it to be cancelled ( i didnt ) and cant issue a new PAC as they have closed the mobile account. Hours later on chat as they have killed my mobile contract and two abrupt dropping of chat I am getting no where other than go into the Ombudsman.

I looked at other providers and found one company with a really good deal offering the latest phone and watch, significant data and absolutely no price increases during the term of the contract. I phone Vodafone to see if they would match this deal but despite my loyalty over those years, they were not prepared to offer anything like that. No compromise, just sorry no can do, so regretfully I have taken my business elsewhere. Vodafone have been slow when it came to 5G so that helped my decision.

1,"Absolutely baffled by Vodafone's upgrade policy. I've been a paying customer, never missed a bill, and now that I‚Äôm eligible for an upgrade, they‚Äôve declined it after a fresh credit check? Excuse me? What other network does that? I was previously with O2, and if you paid off your device, you could upgrade freely‚Äîno ridiculous hoops to jump through and certainly no invasive credit checks just to give them more money.Vodafone, you might want to rethink your priorities. Alienating loyal, creditworthy customers over something as petty and nonsensical as a credit check for an upgrade is how you lose people. It's not 2009 anymore‚Äîusers have options, and I, for one, will be exploring every single one of them. You‚Äôve officially made it to the list of ‚Äúnetworks to avoid at all costs.‚ÄùUnbelievable.",Yusuf Morris,GB,2025-05-11T10:40:04.000Z

They kept sending me a text to put in my card details I was on hold for ages and they kept saying payment had not gone through. They would not let me hang up and I was on hold for ages. Very arrogant customer adviser with a lack of empathy. I lost my temper and I had to hang up. Disgusting service.

1,"I was supposed to be connected on 17 April. They told me a couple of days before the 17th that city fiber engineers faced a challenge. They call me and explain that they will get the next update around the 30th. I call them on the 30th and they have no update! They told me that I will be connected by 8 May. I wait again and call them a couple of days before the 8th. It turns out that city fiber wants me to get a consent from my neighbor to dig in their garden. I find this request ridiculous and also very unspecific (how much of their garden do they need to dig?). I ask specific questions and wait again for a couple of days. Then they now tell me that an engineer can attend and explain what needs to be done but the earliest they can do is the 29th of May.Before choosing Vodafone, one thing I should have realized is that they rely on City Fiber for connecting my home to the network. They may promise a date but that is if only everything goes well. This is different from a company that actually owns a fiber network.Even within the providers depending on City Fiber‚Äôs network, I think I would choose a different one because I get the sense that Vodafone does not take any proactive steps to connect me as soon as possible. They have not called me once since the challenge became obvious. If I hadn‚Äôt called them and asked what is going on, I wouldn‚Äôt have received any updates. They seem to have no way to prioritize me even though I am waiting to be connected for three weeks.EDIT: the copy and paste reply to this review accurately summarizes my experience. They are extremely friendly but do not listen to customers.",RT,GB,2025-05-10T21:52:00.000Z

1,"When I set up my broadband and phone, the site kept crashing on me. So I ended up joining over the phone.  I've never been able to login in. I can't reset the password either, as the reset code message never gets sent to my phone. I've never been sent a bill, I've been getting charged every month. But I don't actually know what for. Some months its a bit more or a bit less, but I have no idea why. As I've never been able to see a bill.I got an email this week saying my contract was up. But as I've never been able to log in, I couldn't see the offers. I got so fed up that I couldn't log in so I changed providers. But now they want to charge me a ¬£80 early leaving fee. But I've never seen my contract, so I don't actually know what day it ends on. I think I'm just going to have to take the ¬£80 hit for my sanity. We are just going around and around in circles with customers services. (They always try to be helpful, but we never get anywhere. The AI chatbot that they keep pushing you to on the website is useless though).It just really annoys me, why tell me the contract is ending and then charge me a early leaving fee. ¬£80 is quite a lot money for me. I really feel like there has been an IT issue with my account since I joined that seems to be unfixable.  Edit - The reply below is exactly my point. I get the same script over and over again. Going around and around in circles until I feel like banging my head off a wall. That's why I'm cutting my losses and leaving. Even though I think its grossly unfair that I'm getting charged a leaving fee, when Vodafone told me my contract was finished. I'm losing money now because Vodafone can't seem to fix my account details on your own system. You don't seem to have someone who can actually fix the problem. I think the details were entered incorrectly when I joined, and I don't know what the operator has entered as my details. That's why I can't get anywhere. And why does it have to be done via Facebook or X. Why can't you give people an email address for example.",Daniel G,GB,2025-05-10T20:01:58.000Z

1,I brought a Samsung zfold 6 from Vodafone 7 months ago. The middle screen has failed at the seam with absolutely no damage to the phone. I spoke to the customer service team and they told me to go in store to get it looked at and fixed. So I drove the 30 minutes to my nearest Vodafone store in scunthorpe who told me they don't deal with it in store and to call Vodafone directly!! I'm now left without a working phone and no bloody idea what to do! Last time I sent my phone away I was told the warranty was voided because of a chip on my screen which I had to prove there wasn't and so this time I'm terrified they will do the same thing. Terrible service.,Courtney,GB,2025-05-10T13:46:38.000Z

1,Abysmal treatment to new customer. Should have been connected 11th April to Vodafone broadband having switched from Sky. What a mistake I've made....Now10th May a month later and still not connected. Paying subscription services I can't access. Never mind the working from home saga. Recieced 21 upselling emails prior to contract start date 11th April. Oddly enough not received anything from them from that date. Wonder why. Only contact was from raising a complaint that to a waste of time and had to ask for an apology. Been told nothing. The customer has to contact them to find out anything in my experience. All that achieves by end of call is the date being moved out another week.At a loss as to what to do. Can't go to a different provider until after my broadband is activated with Vodafone.Shame on you Vodafone.,William,GB,2025-05-10T12:41:30.000Z

1,"Avoid Vodafone Broadband ‚Äì Worst Service ExperienceI signed up for Vodafone broadband expecting a smooth switch using their ""One Touch"" transfer service, which promised a hassle-free, same-day transition. Unfortunately, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. On activation day, I was left with no internet at all.I spent the entire day‚Äî10am to 6pm‚Äîon the phone with Vodafone support, constantly restarting and resetting the modem, with no success. They refused to let me file a formal complaint and left me without service, despite everything working perfectly with my previous provider.I initially chose Vodafone thinking it would be convenient to have broadband and mobile under one bill. Big mistake. I run a home business and rely on internet access for security cameras and daily operations. Vodafone has not only failed to deliver but wasted hours of my time with repetitive, unhelpful steps and no resolution.I'm now cancelling the service after giving them more than enough time to fix the issue. My advice: avoid Vodafone broadband at all costs.",imran nawaz,MA,2025-05-09T18:54:32.000Z

1,"Goodbye Vodafone, a company I've been loyal to for 15 years. I won‚Äôt be back.I never write online reviews. Truly. But after the experience I‚Äôve just had with Vodafone, I felt compelled to make an exception.Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. My phone was stolen in London ‚Äî an unfortunately common occurrence.As part of the usual security protocol, I cancelled all cards that were active on Apple Pay. I went into a Vodafone store the very next day, reported it stolen, and was issued a new SIM card. So far, so good.Then I headed to Apple to sort out a new device. Problem solved? You'd think so, hey.Not a matter of a week later, I began noticing App Store charges coming through on my Vodafone bill ‚Äî not my Apple account. Confused? So was I. How on earth were App Store payments appearing on my Vodafone bill, especially after I had cancelled the linked cards and replaced the SIM?Turns out Vodafone had, without my consent or knowledge, authorised a remote payment sync between my Apple account and Vodafone billing. Something I never agreed to ‚Äî and something that, according to some Vodafone reps, should have been deactivated the moment I reported the phone stolen.I spent a total of six hours on the phone with Vodafone. If I ever hear their hold music again, I might lose my mind. I spoke to countless customer service reps, each with conflicting explanations. Some admitted that the charges should never have gone through. Others tried to shift the blame onto me. All this, despite the fact the charges appeared after I had reported the phone stolen and the SIM replaced.I was told I owed ¬£300. Absolutely not. I refused to pay for a mistake that was clearly theirs. I‚Äôve been a customer for 15 years ‚Äî paying a premium for an overpriced and frankly sub-par service ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm down ¬£2,000 on a new phone and being asked to cover Vodafone‚Äôs screw-up?Eventually, after what felt like hostage negotiations (first they‚Äôd cover 20%, then 50%, then 75%), they finally agreed to remove 100% of the charges. Sounds generous? It wasn‚Äôt. It was damage control ‚Äî for their own mistake. And it took an enormous amount of pressure on my end to get them to do the right thing.This was back in October. So why am I writing this review now?Because it got worse.After clearing the charges, I asked Vodafone to move my account to Pay As You Go, as I‚Äôd recently relocated to the U.S. for 18 months. All seemed fine. Then, during a routine credit check, I discovered a late payment flag from Vodafone had hit my credit score.Baffled, I logged into my account ‚Äî nothing there. I'm on PAYG, so no bills, no charges, no notifications. I call Vodafone again. Guess what? That mysterious late charge? It was from the original bill before they agreed to remove the Apple charges.So despite agreeing to waive the fees ‚Äî again, their error ‚Äî they reported me as having defaulted on a payment. That one flag has now trashed my credit score. For no reason.So here we are. Months of stress, hours of phone calls, gaslighting customer service reps, and a financial headache that‚Äôs still causing ripples.Vodafone: you failed on every front. You mishandled a stolen phone report, tried to make me pay for unauthorised charges, strung me along with inconsistent support, and ultimately damaged my credit over your own mistake.What happened to customer service? What happened to accountability?I‚Äôm done. 15 years of loyalty ‚Äî flushed.Goodbye Vodafone. I won‚Äôt be back.",Sherbert,GB,2025-05-09T17:09:47.000Z

1,Do not ever go with Vodafone broadband.  Their staff told me the hub isn‚Äôt good enough for a house.  I put in a complaint lady called says we will give you a booster.  Half an hour later call saying you need to upgrade to get a booster.  This is after multiple issues with the service.  Would give zero stars if I could.,Mr Stephen Noakes,GB,2025-05-09T17:01:19.000Z

1,"I have used a mobile SIM in my mobile router for some time to provide a basic home broadband solution.It's a shame I've had to leave Vodafone as, when it works, they provide faster indoor speeds than their competitors - however, this has, for some time, been at the expense of appalling reliability- speed frequently drops to <3mbps & often fails completely. It seems that any issue reports dissappear down a black hole as they simply don't care.",Carl Lubbock,GB,2025-05-09T16:04:58.000Z

No matter if your contract includes 50GB or 500GB of data per month, the moment you run out of data, they charge ¬£15 for just 2 extra GB‚Äîa blatant cash grab.

1,"I was moving house so had a mobile vodaphone wi-fi dongle for the last couple of months as I didn't want to renew the contract I had. When I moved, I phoned to pay my final bill and to give them the required 30 days notice. When I paid my bill, the advisor told me I would have nothing else to pay. I then received a final bill request for ¬£51 which of course, I phoned up to complain about as I had been told I had nothing left to pay. Eventually I managed to get through to an actual person instead of their useless virtual assistant and after a lot of wasted time he agreed to listen to the pohone call but said it would take seven days . He arranged to phone me on the 1st May but didn't. On the 3rd May I got a final bill for ¬£5 which I reluctantly paid. On the 8th May at 11.18 I got another final bill for ¬£35.11 and then at 11.19 I got a third final bill for ¬£14.36 and then got a phone call from the advisor who was supposed to phone me on the 1st May. This company is an absolute disgrace and they make it very hard for you to find out exactly how to complain. You can search their website till you are blue in the face and you won't find a simple email address to complain to. They are not a company I would ever want to deal with again.

1,"I recently switched from VOXI to Vodafone and had an extremely frustrating experience due to Vodafone‚Äôs incompetent customer support. The first agent assured me that I could keep my old number by simply filling out a number transfer form. Since I was using an eSIM, I specifically asked how to fill in the serial number section, and the agent told me to just enter all zeros.A week later, my number still hadn‚Äôt transferred. When I contacted support again, a different agent informed me that I needed a physical SIM card first‚Äîcompletely contradicting the first agent‚Äôs instructions. By this point, I was fed up and requested to cancel the Vodafone service and revert to VOXI. Shockingly, the agent said I would still be charged for the days I ""used"" Vodafone, even though this entire mess was caused by their own employee‚Äôs misinformation.This level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, despite multiple attempts to get them to put me on a big value bundle (paying for it, being told it has worked), it never seems to work and i get phone credit instead if a bundle, which runs out very quickly.

1,"I recently switched to Vodafone‚Äôs FTTP broadband expecting a more reliable and faster service than my old Sky copper connection. Unfortunately, the opposite has been true.The WiFi range throughout the house has been shockingly poor. I contacted Vodafone support and, instead of resolving the issue, they suggested I pay extra for their SuperWifi plan ‚Äî essentially upselling a fix for a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.What‚Äôs most frustrating is the customer service. I was repeatedly asked to carry out the same technical tests on the router, even after explaining multiple times that the issue was with coverage, not the line. It‚Äôs baffling that in 2025, a broadband provider can't offer a router that covers a standard household without additional costs.It feels like Vodafone deliberately supplies a subpar router just to push customers into paying more each month. This isn‚Äôt just bad service ‚Äî it‚Äôs bad practice.I regret switching and would caution others to think twice before moving to Vodafone for broadband.Update:I got in touch with Vodafone again through the Facebook link provided and was told to call them just to have the same script narrated to me about how I need boosters for WiFi to work effectively and this time CS advisor was arguing that I cannot compare two providers because the router is not faulty and different routers have different WiFi ranges (when I mentioned Sky's copper broadband giving me better WiFi coverage). I also reviewed all the 'upgrade offers' Vodafone has under my account and again they are actively promoting Superwifi plan so ultimately you pay ¬£4-5 a month extra for boosters which cost less than ¬£10 for Vodafone to continue rent out equipment to make up for their router providing suboptimal coverage. During the phone call I asked to leave Vodafone given I am still within the cooling off period.",KM,GB,2025-05-08T14:30:52.000Z

1,"I spent over two hours on webchat with customer service after noticing that the broadband deal I signed up for today had already dropped in price by ¬£1 per month. Since I‚Äôm still within the cooling-off period, I reasonably asked if the price could simply be adjusted.Instead, I was told the only option was to cancel the entire contract, return the equipment (installed just hours ago), and then place a new order. I haven‚Äôt even moved into the property yet, so logistically it‚Äôs doable‚Äîbut the policy is unnecessarily rigid and completely inflexible for something so minor.To make things worse, after waiting to be connected to a manager, the chat disappeared with no follow-up. When I asked about how to make a formal complaint, I was told there is no complaints email, making the process deliberately difficult and frustrating.This kind of experience does not inspire confidence. A bit of common sense and flexibility would go a long way.***I don't have social media and don't think I need to create accounts there to file complaints. The complaint process must not be unnecessarily complicated. I expected that someone would have reached out to me given the chat disconnected due to a system glitch, as per the text you've sent.

I cancelled in Feb and they continued to bill me into May. Trying to get a conclusion to this bureaucratic farce proved pointless. I am now going to trading standards and the local press because this shambolic excuse for a company can't even deal with THEIR own problem. Never in my life have I encountered such a useless company. Avoid like the plague if you value your precious time and mental health! BTW....I am still waiting for them to call me back, but I won't hold my breath Update: 8/7/25 They still expect me to chase them on their fb page.....nope! You lot said you would phone me so that's what I expect you to do. I spent 2 hours on the phone for nothing yesterday.  I am DONE chasing you for your mistakes.

My order was confirmed, agreement signed, logins all sorted and confirmations sent from Vodaphone.I ring them on the day the new phone was suppose to be delivered, I spend 45 mins on the phone for them to tell me that the warehouse team did not receive the order and it is a technical glitch, the only option was to cancel the order and reorder later on stating that I ""might"" get the same deal. Completely unfair when they said it was all their fault. I am also not wasting more of my time for their incompetence and their error by telling me to reorder or go into a store. The issue could be resolved but the easiest option was to start again.I am not going to have a go at the colleague on the phone as it is not his fault, but this has completly put me off joining, I will not join as a new customer. The fact that they did not care when I said I would not be reordering kind of confirmed my thinking.Watch now give a generic message about how I can reach out and contact them, thank you for wasting my time and my wife's time who waited all day and took time off work. I was even thinking about changing my broadband, but not anymore.",Josh Walker,GB,2025-05-07T20:25:00.000Z

1,"Due to the terminal illness of my brother in the USA, I was called away suddenly, not knowing when I would return. I've been a client with Vodafone for over ten years. As I was departing the UK, I went online and cancelled my Vodafone via their cancellation link. Within minutes I received confirmation of this, but once stateside some days later received a bill for my monthly service. I am not on a contract and was fully paid up with some days left when I cancelled. On April 7th, having been busy with family illness, I received a bill from Vodafone for my continuing service which I had cancelled weeks earlier and not used since. I went online to Vodafone chat. This began with several minutes of the agent asking if I had any special needs or if there was anything they needed to be made aware of about my circumstance. I made it clear that I left the UK because my brother was terminally ill, with the intent (and notification of) my phone cancellation. I was told that since I didn't apply my STAC number to another phone provider I would be billed until I cancelled (apparently cancellation isn't really cancellation after all!). So on April 7th I cancelled for the second time. Despite my family emergency and traumatic situation, I received no sympathy or support from Vodafone. I might as well have chatted with a bot. Vodafone 'customer care' is cynical and appalling. Next I get a message some days later saying I owed them ¬£17.81 for an overdue balance. For a phone which had not been used and for which the contract had been cancelled a month prior! Busy with other matters (life and death!) I did not immediately attend to this demand for a service I was no longer receiving. Today I received a fresh demand. I now owe ¬£39.98 for an inactive account I have cancelled twice! As it happens my monthly pay as you go was ¬£9 each month; I never went over and I always paid on time. Such blatant profiteering from grief is despicable. When I went online to see what these charges are ... as they are clearly so inflated ... my online account has been deactivated and is inaccessible. So I could just keep paying and paying, for a service I am not receiving at a rate that is re-inflating every few weeks. What a disgusting, corrupt organisation. This is how they pay customer loyalty. And this is how they support their clients. UPDATE: Whilst I appreciate the Vodafone Social Media Team getting in touch, this is a hollow attempt at resolving the problem after I had shown a light on it. I just attempted to contact Vodafone via the link on X provided ... waited an hour for a reply! I was a client in good standing, cancelled my phone service in the way Vodafone set forth, and despite all my efforts, in the hopes of putting things right, I was forced to spent over a half hour on Chat with the 'Vodafone Team' who displayed neither empathy nor genuine interest in understanding my situation or assisting me. The default response from Vodafone seems to be 'just keep charging the client, over and over again without listening.' I now have an email for an amount that has not been explained to me ... and a threat that it will all be turned over to a debt collection agency. A debit sheet where their human concern should be. Now I have filed a formal complaint with Vodafone. Let's see what happens.",Jesse,US,2025-05-22T19:12:09.000Z

1,"Terrible customer serviceI ordered the broadband service on 7th April 2025 to replace my BT home broadband (SoGEA) and phone service. Gave them my address and telephone number to keep.I have a business as well and have a dedicated BT business line that is already on FTTP so understand that an engineer would need to visit to install the fibre service and disconnect the old cable connection.I recieved an email from BT telling me as I was out of contract i would not pay anything and my home broadband and phone would stop when i move to vodafone.Yesterday (6th May) my home broadband stopped working, no engineer and then my business broadband stopped working. I was told by vodafone that the connection can take upto 24 hours to activate.So today, still no vodafone at home and no BT business broadband at the office. I decide to take the vodafone router to the business and low and behold it works. So openreach have decided to take over a business FTTP connection and disconnect a SoGEA one at the same time.On the phone to vodafone for over an hour with the egyptian staff member (Abdul) telling me it is working at the address listed with the telephone number. I ask to make a complaint to wait another 30 mins be to asked what resolution i would like (BT OR to install FTTP at the house and reconnect BT business at the office!?!?!) After the call ending and speaking to someone else still nothing after OVER 3 HOURS apart from a manager may call within 24-48 hours.This has serverly impacted my business and I will be looking to leave vodsfone at the earliest opportunity.I will be sending a complaint in writing to your CEO (Max Taylor) as well as Ofcom.**** update****After spending hours on the phone with poorly trained staff (asking for a serial number of the router and a video call to show the router is not working in its intended location) i havr given up. Vodafone will lose my business, i am trying to get BT business to send an engineer to take over the line again. Vodafone could have sorted this by sending an Openreach engineer to install an fttp connection at the correct location.",Dom,GB,2025-05-08T12:48:59.000Z

1,"I called Vodafone UK to cancel my phone service after using their service for over 2 years. Great connection throughout the time and everything great. However, since I am moving aboard, I called them in Jan 2025 and confirmed with the person on the phone that everything has been cancelled and there's nothing else that I have to do. They asked me to keep my direct debit opened just in case there's any final fee. I then noticed that they continue charging me for Feb and Mar hence I stopped my direct debit. They then started emailing me threatening me that if I do not pay my overdue payment, contract termination fees will be applied, a default being registered with the credit reference agencies, which may make it difficult for me to get loans, credit cards and other phone contracts in the future. I no longer live in the UK but contacted them back to see whats the issue since this shouldn't have happened and hoping for a refund. They then deny anything I told them about the call in Jan 2025 and said I cannot cancel my service until I pay my monthly bill plus extra 5 pound for late payment. I was shocked but still wanting to settle this just in case I need to return to the UK again. This staff on the online chat named Arun took half an hour to verify my identity, replying every 2 mins. Then doing it all again after I pay the fee and transferring me to the cancellation team. At this point I have lost 3 months bills pus extra 5 pound for no reason and now they said that they have cancelled it again and there's nothing that I have do...",William Cheung,GB,2025-05-07T14:49:49.000Z

1,"Vodafone are in a mess. After being a cusotmer for a few years and having three plans with them, I tried to upgrade and order a new phone. I signed all the documents, all the informaiton asked of me was provided. Despite their App crashing and having to call back, which I did, I jumped through every hoop they asked me to. I chased the order through only to find they hadn't processed it. They then quoted me totally different numbers and finally cancelled the phone order but left me with an updated SIM order which, without the phone is a pretty pointless thing to do. I've spend over 1.5 hours on the phone to them today and It's so difficult to get anyone to read the notes. They can't find transcripts from their own app and have no knowledge of the contracts I've signed, even though I offered them copies of their own documents. I'm utterly shocked that a business with such a strong following, is retaining customers if this is how they treat them.",Tim,GB,2025-05-07T12:49:24.000Z

1,"If I could give 0, I literally would. Left me and my partner without a broadband 15 extra days after moving to a new home (when we both WORK FROM HOME!!!!!) due to a fault on their behalf, which resulted in us having to buy extra data to make sure we can work still. And yet no compensation for the distress caused. I have called multiple times, and they have said because there is no automatic compensation applied, they can‚Äôt do anything. I have requested to speak to a manager multiple times, they always have to arrange a call back and surprise, surprise, they only call when I work in the office. Absolutely shocking to be honest. They have no email address so you can‚Äôt even email anyone. You can only write a letter because calling at this point is so pointless. I will be writing a letter, if nothing changes Ombudsman it is. Promising a service and then leaving us for an extra two weeks with no compensation for the mess caused, and then point blank refusing to compensate for the distress caused by is absurd. Definitely a breach of CRA 2015, and I won‚Äôt rest until I am satisfied with an outcome. UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO VODAFONES COMMENT: I have called multiple times with no resolution, I have spoke to your Facebook team that redirected me to call anyway lol, and I have spoken on the chat bot thing. NO ONE is coming to a solution for us.",MT,GB,2025-05-07T09:34:28.000Z

1,"I am surprised to see how many of you have given this company top marks. How many of you have checked your down load upload speeds? Well I have and found the following, I singed up for a 900MB connection and got the following between 200 and 390 MB depending on the time of day. I have complained numerus times, they have tested from their end and tell me would you believe that I am always getting  455 MB. Apparently it is Legal to advertise a connection then only give you half of what your paying for according to Vodaphone.  If your happy to pay for a certain speed and only get half of what your paying at best that is fine but not for me. I would therefore suggest you check your speed by downloading Ookla  free speed test its easy to use and will give you a very accurate result.",Alan Bedford,GB,2025-05-06T14:15:41.000Z
1,"Honestly, one of the most backwards companies I have ever dealt with. First, I‚Äôm told my contract has ended and no further payments will be taken. Then, a few days later, they take money from my account anyway.Naturally, I call to ask why, only to be told about a supposed 30-day closure policy. I understand terms and conditions, but when I‚Äôm explicitly informed that my contract has ended and no further payments will be charged, then money is taken anyway‚Äîit‚Äôs an absolute joke.The punchline? They want yet another payment just to close my account! Ridiculous. I‚Äôve cancelled my direct debit, so good luck getting another penny from me.

1,"Vodafone broadband. I genuinely believe that the call centre staff do not look at your account when you telephone them. I needed to change my banking details as my old bank was closing down. I telephoned the call centre three times at the beginning of April and was assured that there was no issue with my account. I even provided a different account to take payment from. With no notice Vodafhone cut off my internet boardband just before five on Friday 2 May, when I telephoned I was told different things by every different call handler I spoke to. I feel really let down. It took three days for my broadband connection to be restored, eventhough it was their mistake.

1,"Note to Vodafone Social Media Team in response to my previous review of your organisation.I am not on Facebook nor X, therefore the onus is on YOU to resolve this matter. I spent over 2 3/4 hours on your live chat facility and on the telephone to your organisation, collectively, yesterday trying to sort out this matter and reach a satisfactory conclusion but instead I get advised to send an email to a third-party affiliate (which I've done) as Vodafone have decided to take no ownership or responsibility for a technical glitch on their website when I tried to purchase Broadband that has prevented me from receiving the promotional e-giftcard voucher.I've also been in contact with Giftcloud and Broadband comparison websites with a view to finally ascertaining a resolution, but still I am getting nowhere.I am 86 years old and never thought I'd still be fighting the fight at my age to get justice on a matter that is not my fault.I just want to enjoy the rest of my life in peace and without unnecessary barriers being put in my way.",William Stappard,GB,2025-05-06T11:37:26.000Z

5,"We had been experiencing issues with our contracts at Vodafone, and first attempted to resolve it through their online customer support.After an appalling attitude from one customer service agent who made an inappropriate comment, we decided to head into a store.We were greeted by Lorna, a personable, knowledgeable and helpful individual who was enthusiastic to resolve our existing  problems. After hearing the details of our previous experience with online customer support, they swiftly assisted in filing a complaint, and the issue was later concluded. Lorna furthermore demonstrated excellent levels of professionalism, clearly outlining how we could make changes to our contracts where it was lacklustre explained online. After this visit, we had further issues with a separate Vodafone contract, and went in-store on Monday 5th May 2025 after 3 back-and-forth calls with the online customer support team last week to no avail.Despite it being late in the day, and on a bank holiday, we were warmly greeted by Lorna who once again saved the day. Lorna immediately remedied the issue, pointing out an error that was present with the details of the contract. Both of these experiences in-store have been wonderful, with clear communication, sound knowledge of Vodafone policies, friendly and professional demeanour, and a genuine resolution to the issues we were facing. A true 5*, and 10/10 customer experience from Lorna. Thank you!",S,GB,2025-05-06T01:34:59.000Z
1,"I have been a Vodafone customer for over 15 years now and this is by far the worst customer experience I have ever had to go through. I state the years, as it counts for absolutely nothing to them. Unfortunately, when companies are so big, it is easy to fall between the cracks and you are truly just a number (no pun intended). I went for a simple upgrade on the 14th April and my new phone was meant to turn up the next day. No phone, no update, just DPD telling me that it was delayed in transit. Over the next couple of days, Vodafone had no update for me. I was then told that I had to wait for 6 working days for DPD to do a full investigation. On the 6th working day, I called Vodafone and they confirmed it had been lost (the phone call was an hour and 20 mins long and I was on hold for an hour and 10 mins of that time and not once did the agent come back on the line). I eventually got the chance to ask if they can send a new phone now, seeing as the outcome had been confirmed, which they said no. They have to close down the matter their side and a further escalation has to happen within Vodafone and that I'll get a phone call within 2 working days. A few days later, my phone call never came from the escalation team. By this point I am now 2 weeks without a phone and have spent over 4 hours on live chat and phone calls. I emailed over a very candid message and someone called me within 20 mins of that message. I was told to wait 2 more days for them to close the order and that they would call me. The 2 days passed on Friday 2nd May. I am still awaiting a new phone with tomorrow marking the 3 week anniversary. I write this review to not only show the ineptitude of Vodafone and their complete and utter lack of care for their customers but also so people contemplating upgrading or using Vodafone for the first time, to reconsider and go elsewhere, it's just not worth it, even just for their protocols alone. You will be left and forgotten about. Edit: to respond to the comments below and for clarity to the reader, this is an official complaint and was raised on the 25th April. It's now the 6th May.....still no response.",Mike,GB,2025-05-06T13:21:19.000Z

1,"I want to get this out there with anyone who is thinking of joining vodafone or are currently either with them or disconnecting from them... when you're with them, things seem to be okay, no issues unless you need customer support, but by christ, you need deep pockets if you're thinking of leaving.. my partner has been stung twice in this situation. Once with her phone, secondly with her WiFi. On both occasions vodafone had mentioned that contracts have been completely paid off but later on emailed her demanding money months later down the line. With a bill of exactly ¬£178 twice! Not one warning...not one warning at all, nearly setting her back ¬£500 on contracts that together dont reach ¬£60 a month! Absolutely rubbish customer service! But a company thay simply takes money from people with no care in the world, sort it out.. disgusting. Don't go with vodafone if you want your moneys worth for anything. Go to EE they offer better coverage too",Jack Evans,GB,2025-05-05T20:32:07.000Z

1,Awful service provider and worse network coverage. I have been charged for more than 9 months for not using my mobile broadband. I visited the office and the manager told me he can't help me. I contacted customer care and there were even more unhelpful. I filed a complaint and absolutely nothing has been done. They make promises and dont keep them and i am fed up. I don't understand what service at all they provide.,SON OF MAN,GB,2025-05-05T10:39:46.000Z
1,Awful network. Used to be brilliant. In last 18months absolutely rubbish. If there was a option for 0 star I'd give it. Customer service is average. Even 3 network has better service and you can hardly get through to them.The signal is atrocious! Networks like 02 and ee have improved massively in comparison to vodafone in the past 3 years!Sort your signal out vodafone as people are moving on to other networks!,Mo Kara,GB,2025-05-05T00:54:06.000Z

1,"My elderly parents decided to go with Vodafone after seeing reviews. They have been with Vodafone for broadband since August 2024 and last night around 8pm the broadband went down. After calling them this morning 8.30am my father advises no internet since 8pm previous evening. I call Vodafone who obviously won‚Äôt discuss anything (GDPR) I ask them to call my father and they do. Trouble shooting for hours and not getting anywhere . Various calls to and from Vodafone, probably between us six to eight calls and yet it‚Äôs now 5.22pm and still no internet. My mother has a heart monitor machine for her ICD that requires internet,  being elderly they rely on broadband for tv and to use video calls and check their emails, they‚Äôre pretty much cut off. They are visiting the Vodafone shop tomorrow to see if they get anywhere as there‚Äôs onlySo many times they can go through the troubleshooting, reset machine turn off and on, put a pin in the pin hole of the router and wait etc etc‚Ä¶.. not sure when they plan to sort it or even if they plan toBut these guys are unbelievable , never had customer service so bad",Carolyn Williams,GB,2025-05-04T18:27:51.000Z

I can‚Äôt log in because I don‚Äôt have a number.Another phone call to customer services and was told that they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt do anything until you get the bill‚Äô.

1,"I stupidly stuck with vodafone at contract renewal, despite their service being routinely rubbish. They sold me a brand new iPhone which continually crashes. To begin with, it crashed once every two weeks, but now, 3 months later, it crashes every 2 days, and they will do nothing about it, other than to take my phone away from me to send it away to get ‚Äúfixed‚Äù.

1,"Dreadful customer service. I have been with Vodafone for both my mobile and broadband for more years than i care to remember. I could view both my mobile and broadband bills on the app, a good service.That was until i bought another mobile contract from another provider but it was a totally new contract with Vodafone.All of a sudden I had a problem. I could only view my mobile bill, i didn't receive my together discount which they promote if you have both mobile contract and broadband contract with them, i also dont get the together offers on the app, these are the bonus offers on Myvodafone app. For nearly a full year now I have spent an inordinate amount of time on live chat(2 hours at a time) attempting to get them to merge both my broadband and mobile to one account. Yesterday 1 spent another 1.5 hours on to their customer services, they passed me between different depts, one told me he couldnt merge my accounts as i had to fill in a form asking them to merge both accounts. I filled in this form 8 months ago and told him that. He then kept me waiting 15 mins whilst he checked, he then confirmed i wasn't lying and they had the form but nothing had been done with it!! Next he told me he'd have to transfer me to another department as my credit check was outdated???? What? I have had my mobile with vodafone for around 15 years, broadband for 5 in my current home.He was basically fobbing me off, i dont think he knew how to merge the accounts. How hard can it be? I asked to speak to his Manager, he kept me waiting 10 mins then asked me to explain what i thought his Manager could do for me? At that, I gave up. I told him it'd be easier to take my business elsewhere, they are nowhere near the cheapest anyway. I wouldn't under any circumstances recommend vodafone to anybody due to their complete lack of customer care. In fact I'd go further and actively discourage anybody i know from using them, simply because of a complete lack of interest in a customers needs.Please go elsewhere because if you don't have a ridiculous amount of spare time to talk to their customer services, you have no choice but to resigb yourself to the fact, issues will not be sorted by vodafone. Dreadful company. I'll find a new provider this weekend, i give up on them. My mobile will move too when i'm out of contract.  ***UpdateVodafone have responded, unbelievably they spelled my name incorrectly and even more unbelievably, they have suggested I contact them, by LIVE CHAT would you believe. My god, what has happened to this company. Kind regards BRIAN. Not Brain",Brian Oneill,GB,2025-05-04T16:39:56.000Z

1,"Do not choose Vodafone Broadband. Until recently I had been happy with my home broadband, but in the past couple of weeks dealing with the service has become a nightmare. Apparently someone (unknown, certainly NOT me) requested a new provider so Vodafone contacted me ""sorry you're leaving etc etc). I contacted customer service, tried phone and then resorted to the online chat service, and after numerous different agents was eventually reassured that this was all an error and my service would not be disconnected, however as of yesterday I have no broadband at home and despite wasting another couple of hours between chatbots and phone (I was cut off the call after 40 minutes!!) I am no further. I cannot work from home and they are apparently going to bill me ¬£111.39 as an early termination fee for a disconnect that I have explained repeatedly I did not request. Noone seems to be able to sort this out, and they called it a 'seized line' I was offered a whole new account and a 2 week wait for what should have been a continuous service. Dealing with this company is one of the most frustrating experiences.*UPDATE* Now almost three weeks before connection and as I do not have a Vodafone mobile they have washed their hands of providing me with any alternative in the interim.  Apparently company policy precludes sending me anything like a wifi dongle. That would be too useful.  I also have to contact them again when the termination fee appears as they will have to manually reverse it. I have had to set up an entirely new account. This has taken about 7 hours of online chats; almost a whole working day. I could weep.",Michelle,GB,2025-05-04T19:24:45.000Z

1,"Vodafone must be the worst company for broadband so far. Was promised to get connected on 28th of April and so far on May 2nd no Internet. I work from home so this is incredibly frustrating having no access to the Internet.  Having been on the phone to them more than 10 times, they're no closer to solving the problem than in the beginning. Initially they blamed open reach before admitting that the "" order hasn't been completed"" by them despite having sent all the necessary equipment and not once during setup did they mention that they would need to be called. I called them again and requested to speak to the manager in which I was promised a phone call but many hours later no one called me. Still without Internet for the weekend. Very shambolic company. I wouldn't wish Vodafone broadband on my worst enemy. To add salt to the wound, apparently I can't cancel the contract until it's services is live, hence I'm at their mercy. Avoid like a plague.",Dami,GB,2025-05-02T23:00:50.000Z

1,"Never use Vodafone! I have never actually used Vodafone, but after my partner‚Äôs experience I certainly NEVER will! He has had the worst possible experience from a huge and well known company. They charged him for 2 broadband packages without his knowledge and their ineptitude in resolving a phone line not working resulted in his business missing important calls from customers. After multiple contacts with them and promises of compensation, he has had nothing. The latest in this farce is that the compensation owed cannot be sent to him due to admin errors! I would have thought that a multi million pound company would be able to sort such simple problems. What ludicrous customer service and how embarrassing for the staff that work there. It will be nice when one day we won‚Äôt have to complain about more Vodafone tomfoolery!",EllieLeech,GB,2025-05-02T15:58:12.000Z
1,"It got worse. The mobile was found to be ready after all, but when I got home and opened the box, someone had slung in the wrong kind of charger. I give up. The contract is getting cancelled. Who takes all that money and sets up a contract then supplies the wrong items? Well, it happens, but the level of argument from the team recommended by the response below is off the scale. No, they couldn't look up the details of the phone and simply send me a proper charger. It's a poor outlook in the event of more issues.***Everything happened quickly after Vodafone responded (below). Whereas the customer services adviser had said I couldn't collect the phone until tomorrow, suddenly a message came - it was ready after all. Having seen the laconic attitude in the Braintree store twice this week, I'd guess they simply couldn't be bothered to arrange collection today. Not until they got chased following my TP comments.***I'm waiting for a new phone which was promised for today. No text has arrived, and clearly, it isn't ready to collect. A call to customer services got me an email address and I sent a message, to which no one has responded from the shop in Braintree. Then a demand to fill in a survey arrived. The customer service assistant then called me, to urge me to fill it in. I explained, I had deleted it since the process was not complete, and she made me feel guilty. I suggested she might resubmit it but she was dismayed and said she could not. This isn't my fault. All I want is the proper service, which I was promised on Wednesday.",Lisette,GB,2025-05-04T01:51:25.000Z

After looking into it I was owed over ¬£300 by Vodafone who admitted an admin error and advised the refund would be back in my account within 30 days. 30 days go by, still no refund. I contacted Vodafone, again. To be told there was another admin error and the refund wasn't processed. I'd need to wait another 30 days for my refund. I advised this wasn't acceptable and I wanted a bank refund within 24 hours. This came to a deadlock with their only solution being, the refund will be back in 30 days.

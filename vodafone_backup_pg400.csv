1,"Trying to buy broadband through Uswitch, then having multiple errors on checkout, only for customer services to say that they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt match third parties‚ÄôThere‚Äôs no matching needed, it‚Äôs a deal that‚Äôs come through from Uswitch!

1,"Held to ransom by a ‚Äòreputable‚Äô company. Purchased a sim only plan March 2023 for my mobile dongle. Service was fine for a while then poor so stopped using the sim in early 2024 but continued to pay as I had been told in a Vodafone shop that I would have to pay the full remainder of the sim plan up front to cancel early. At the end of the contract in March 2025 my 24 months was up so stopped paying. At this point I had paid over ¬£350 for a service I had not used, which as I said above, upon the advice of the person at Vodafone, I accepted. Today, (5/6/25) I received a letter from Vodafone for the first time (that was not them trying to get me to purchase their home broadband) dated 30/5/25 saying I had an outstanding bill of ¬£67.18, which had been sent to a debt collector and would be reported to the CRA on 4/6/25 which had already passed when I got the letter. I called Vodafone immediately, explained the situation and they demanded a payment of ¬£98.32 for 3 months of service that they continued to provide me as they said there was no record of my attempt to end the contract in 2024 or my issues with the poor service. I said to them that I had paid til the end of my contract and then cancelled but they said there was no record and that in order to cancel and avoid further charges I had to pay the almost ¬£100 which I certainly cannot afford. I an raising a formal complaint as I am disgusted by this greed and poor service. I want others to avoid the same experience that I have had. They‚Äôll happily take your money for a service they‚Äôre not providing. Recon they will still report to the CRA despite holding me to ransom and forcing me to pay something I can‚Äôt afford. Appalled. Avoid at all costs.",Chloe,GB,2025-06-05T20:24:59.000Z

1,"This is the complaint I submitted to Vodafone: I was about to move flat and so I have ordered a home broadband for 19A M** Street . 2 days later I realised it was actually 19B M** Street and so I called your number, one of your agent told me ""NO WORRIES! YOU CAN CHANGE THE ADDRESS EVEN AFTER YOU RECEIVE THE ROUTER, THAT'S OK"" and so I waited. The day came and waited for the activation which never happened, the same day my neighbour at 19A got his broadband deactivated because of YOUR mistake. So now I have to wait 2 more weeks for a new broadband to be activated in my address (AND I WORK FROM HOME) since you can't provide that to me and my neighbour will have to wait 10 days to have everything sorted out, BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOMPETENCE. While I am on the phone with this agent to sort everything out she told me that she submitted the complaint to her manager which would have called me.. eventually. That's funny because that OBVIOUSLY never happened. But what disgust me the most is that when I call the first time to change my address YOUR AGENT CHECKED IF 19B WAS FINE AND THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY ""YES IT IS"" EVEN THOUGH IN THEIR SCREENS IT WASN'T. I worked for Vodafone and I know how it works, I will make sure to spend 5 minutes everyday to write on every social and every reviews website how CRAP you actually are. Don't try to call me because I won't answer, emails only. You wasted 1 MONTH of my precious time, the minimum would be to receive a refund for the fuel I had to spend to go to the office everyday because of your incompetence.

1,I have been experiencing very very poor signal/reception using for phone calls to both incoming and outgoing voice keeps breaking and the signals bars change to one point more frequently in my area Slough Berkshire When spoke to customer service they asked me to pay off my whole contract amount to exit from Vodafone very frustrating and called couple times standing outside of my house to the network team but the calls keeping disconnected after the wait of 35 minutes initially some lift the call take all details to verify me and when they transferred the call to technical team after wait of half an hour the calls get disconnected with no response very frustrating.Called customer care and been waiting for over an hour to connect. Still hopeless to get the support from Vodafone every attempt to call for disconnection needs waiting for over an hour but when we call for new connection the calls keeping disconnected gets connected in 5 minutes,Bharath Bashetty,GB,2025-06-05T12:51:28.000Z

1,"I was a customer of BT‚Äôs full fibre service for two years, and switched to Vodafone only because of a cheaper offer ‚Äî and I deeply regret it! Their internet service is completely unreliable. Every time I struggle to get in touch ‚Äî due to Vodafone‚Äôs outdated and frustrating communication system ‚Äî I‚Äôm met with generic, meaningless responses. Their support team clearly lacks a basic understanding of simple networking concepts.Vodafone‚Äôs full fibre setup has fundamental issues, and the speeds they advertise simply don‚Äôt exist in practiceI am a professional Video Editor and always need to send a receiving large video files.

1,"After a formal complaint and a lengthy back-and-forth, Vodafone finally agreed to reduce my airtime from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11 a month and credited my account with ¬£50 ‚Äî supposedly covering two months. I thought the issue was resolved.Then suddenly, on 4 June, Vodafone took three separate payments from my account:‚Ä¢ ¬£25.46 (airtime ‚Äî which was supposed to be reduced!)‚Ä¢ ¬£10.00 (device)‚Ä¢ ¬£12.00 (device)I‚Äôm not disputing the device charges ‚Äî but the ¬£25.46 goes directly against what was agreed. Once again, I‚Äôm left chasing Vodafone for money I didn‚Äôt consent to pay, after being told this was sorted.This situation has added unnecessary financial pressure and stress, especially when I‚Äôve done everything Vodafone asked and acted in good faith. I‚Äôve now had to escalate again and CC the CEO. Why should I keep dealing with mistakes that Vodafone promised were resolved?This is unacceptable, and I hope this public review helps push for accountability ‚Äî again.After reaching a formal agreement with Vodafone (Ref: 138249138), I was told my airtime bill would drop from ¬£25.46 to around ¬£11/month and that I had been credited ¬£50 to cover the next two months. I was finally starting to feel some relief after all the stress I‚Äôd already gone through.But despite this agreement, Vodafone took the full ¬£25.46 airtime payment again on 4 June ‚Äî on top of the ¬£10 and ¬£12 device plan payments. I never disputed the device charges, but the airtime charge should NOT have been taken.This isn't just a technical error ‚Äî it‚Äôs had a real and serious impact on me. I am already in a financial crisis, and this unnecessary charge has made things worse. I feel crippled by stress from having to deal with Vodafone over and over, especially after the rude and dismissive treatment I received from one of their representatives. That experience alone left a lasting emotional impact I still haven‚Äôt been able to move past.To feel some hope through a resolution, only to have it undone without explanation, has made things worse than before. This isn‚Äôt just poor service ‚Äî it‚Äôs neglectful and harmful.I've now had to escalate this again and CC Vodafone's CEO, Max Taylor, in my latest complaint. I‚Äôm also prepared to go to CISAS if this is not resolved swiftly and fairly. Enough is enough.",Farida Ali,GB,2025-06-05T15:54:34.000Z
1,Unfortunately can‚Äôt give zero stars. Vodafone make it as difficult as possible if want to change your contract or buy a sim only vodafone deal from carphone warehouse which they call a 3rd party provider. They want you to do a vodafone upgrade which essentially gives them more money (around ¬£100 more over contract term) and despite a couple of the staff on retention team stating you can do it with a post to post migration they continue to be as awkward as possible and simply want to make more sales. Spent hours on their utterly useless live chat presumably from India where their was a complete lack of communication. Unable to resolve any issues which aren‚Äôt straightforward. Telephoned retentions and on hold for 30 mins only to have the most useless member of staff Mohammad who stated I need to upgrade and have to get a pay as you go sim and transfer after 30 days. Called back next day to be told something completely different and don‚Äôt need to do that. Ended up doing an upgrade as loosing the will to live with them and just wanted it sorted. Definitely changing provider next time.,Ross,GB,2025-06-05T03:30:54.000Z

1,Pathetic service. The app was down on 3/6/25. I wasn‚Äôt aware at the time and called 191 at 3.27pm and spoke to the most incompetent call handler i have ever dealt with. He told me that Vodafone was no longer allowing top ups for any one on the app and that I would have to buy a voucher from a shop. I found this really odd and even asked for a PAC code to move providers . Luckily I didn‚Äôt listen to him and waited instead and the app issue replaced itself.

1,"I upgraded my device with the option to trade in - this was for the value of ¬£400.I was under the assumption that the ¬£400 credit would be applied to my account and I would pay my bill as usual. Vodafone received my device and confirmed the ¬£400 credit with a green banner within the MyVodafone app that stated ""You have ¬£400 account credit"".When it came to paying my bill, I received a notification that my Direct Debit would be ¬£400 higher this month. I called Vodafone and they advised that the credit could not be applied to my current bill, but I could use it on the next one. Meaning I would be ¬£400 down for a month. I am not really in a position to be able to do this, which is why I traded in the old device. I called Vodafone and asked if this could be refunded to my bank account if I made the payment - I was advised it could be. I hesitated paying this, as it would (and now has) put me in a difficult financial situation - I cannot be without broadband and mobile as I work from home, so today I paid the bill.I called Vodafone to ask about this credit being returned to me, and honestly feel like my intelligence is being questioned.. The agent I spoke to (Loretta) was very helpful, but told me initially that it owuldn't be possible to have the credit paid out to me as ""it is still accruing in the account, and is currently only at ¬£393.."" this makes absolutely no sense. Loretta went away to speak to some other team and came back and said that it would not be possible as that credit has not been ""allocated"".. even though I can see in a big green box that I have ¬£400 credit. I then asked Loretta if I could then just have the ¬£393, if that is what has ""accrued"". She went away again to speak to another team for quite a while and then came back to tell me this is not possible and I would have to wait until the next billing cycle. I then asked Loretta if she could confirm that that account credit would still be available when my next bill is issued, rather than being used to pay the bill and she said ""No, we will deduct the billed amount before sending the funds""I really feel like my intelligence is being insulted.. the account credit is there, it is not ""accruing"" - the device I traded in was a whole device, I didn't send it piece by piece so it makes no sense that the credit would ""accrue"". I understand that companies want to do as much as they can to not have to transfer funds out, but I was told that this was possible, without any caveats about the credit needing to accrue, or be allocated (it clearly has been allocated as I can see available credit within my app to be used!Please either arrange for a refund or return my device. I am now out of pocket due to a very poorly executed trade-in process and a billing team that clearly just want to try to avoid making any payouts.",Den,GB,2025-06-04T17:22:22.000Z

1,"10 weeks from planned activation date, Openreach finally finished the incomplete work to install our Full Fibre connection! Vodafone then instruct our current provider to disconnect us and leave us with no Internet connection at all!It's a very long story:Ordered our Vodafone full fibre on 7th JanChoose 1st available Openreach appointment - March 21st.  Prior to this, Openreach contractors dug up the path at the end of our driveway, not very neatly21st March arrives and Openreach engineer tells us he cannot fit the cable to the house becausethe initial ground works were not completed correctly. No rope to pull cable through conduit, ground junction box is filled with tarmac, no connection box installed on wall.2nd engineer apt is made for March 28th - still unable to complete as apparently there is a blockage!I chat every week to Vodafone who blame the issue on Opereach and every week say there is a blockage that requires a specialist engineer - the issue is with the chief engineer who has a heavy workload!On 17th may Vodafone say Openreach promise the work will be done by 23rd May which as predicted does not happen!23rd May - Vodafone agent has the sense to tell me they are raising an official escalation with Openreach. Unsure why this hasn't been done by any other of the agents until so far down the line!2nd June - Openreach engineer calls me and says will arrive in 20mins. Finishes the connection within half hour and says it is up and running. He doesn't know what the blockage or issue is meant to be as he has no problem running the cable inside or connecting the router so who knows what we have been waiting for over the last 10 weeks!Shortly after he leaves, Vodafone instruct my provider to disconnect but the new Vodafone connection doesn't start working!That afternoon, I spend 1hr speaking to tech support going through troubleshooting and they finally tell me they will send a new router as firmware out of date.3rd June - I chat online to ask for confirmation the router will arrive today. Tech support now tell me that there is nothing wrong with the router as it is a new Power Hub!Whilst another agent is trying to find out what the issue is, I get disconnected from my mobile data as a result of trying to connect to WiFi as asked.  I then reconnect to yet another agent!I reconnect to another agent and speak to him for an hour, switching, unplugging, resetting, updating etc then get disconnected again as I am relying on mobile data!I rejoin the queue and chat to agent no 3, really loosing hope now! They then say they will pass me to the activations team as my order is still in open status! They have obviously admitted defeat! I asked to speak to a manager but apparently I have to speak to an activations team member first! Speak to this team member who asks me yet again to reset the router and updates something their end! Of course it doesn't make any difference and they transfer me to a manager. Turns out yesterday's promised router won't arrive until tomorrow but they place yet another order to send a 2nd one out today! They have gone back to believing the router needs replacing because of the firmware which strangely can't be done remotely. Speak to shift mgr who just repeats what I have already been told.  End my chat at 4hrs!4th June - Amazingly, the new router arrives and actually connects to the new network! I'm hoping this is the last time I need to chat to Vodafone but am not optimistic! Since January we have been paying ¬£14 more per mth to our existing provider as we are out of contract! The max compensation Vodafone will pay is ¬£374.40 (¬£6.24 x 60 days) This is the only reason we haven't cancelled. We also have 2 Vodafone mobile contracts in the household but although the internet is up and running now, I will not be choosing Vodafone for anything again in the future, due to how this was handled. I have been told today, the compensation won't be applied to my account until August. The least they could do is apply it to the 1st bill",Cath,GB,2025-06-04T16:17:47.000Z

1,Bad all over. even if they resolve the issue. I wont remove this comment because it should not have happened in the first place.  I signed up for ¬£29 contact. asked clearly on the call if I will incur extra charges. Was advised no. It took 4 week for the installation. was told I will get compensation for ¬£6 a day delay. I get my first bill . its ¬£59 been asked to pay it as they didn‚Äôt do the DD when I asked them to. which makes me ask why did they take my DD details if DD was not set up?

4,"Having been with Vodafone for at least 10 years now, I decided to leave this year, as the offers weren't as cheap anymore for what I need. I never cared much for the latest phone but needed roaming, minutes and texts as well as some data. Due to my job, I received 20% off the bill and still paid about ¬£28 per month. This doesn't appear a lot compared to some people who pay ¬£50-¬£60 with a phone included but overall, they have always been responsive and helpful. The network is hit and miss at times but I can't fault them for having been a good company but unfortunately your rates don't compare to other companies these days, who offer similar Sim only deals for half the price. Now I pay ¬£7 per month with no price rises, roaming included, unlimited texts and minutes and 30GB data per month, which rolls over, so ideal for me.",Jasmin,GB,2025-06-04T15:18:57.000Z

1,"I have been a Vodafone broadband customer for since last 3 years; I started facing issues 1 year later. I am out of my Vodafone contract since October 2025. Now I left my old rented home on May 19, 2025 .When I requested for a disconnection with Vodafone on 25 April 2025 they told they could only disconnect on 26th May 2025. So I agreed, and they raised the disconnection request. I got a confirmation email and a sorry to see u go email on the same day from Vodafone. Then After 3 weeks, on May 14, they took the bill for June and send another confirmation email saying i am disconnecting services on 27th of June. When I approached the Vodafone support, they didn't have any clue they escalated to 3 different teams, wasted 3 hours in chat and later they told I wouldn't be able to disconnect because the new tenant raised an connection request with another vendor, and hence I need to continue to pay the bill until they find the issue. So I removed my debit last week, as I am not using the internet, and moved out of the rented house on 19th MAY. although  I already lost the payment taken for June month .The reason is so silly; I don't know how a reputed company can behave in a stupid way.  After all these conversations, the customer care team is asking me to take a mobile data plan which looks like they are least bothered about their customer concerns rather than selling their product. Now I can see a couple of bills have been generated till July 2025 hope they will continue for an infinite number of day even though they don't have any connection. I am not sure what to do. Do I need to go to consumer court or complain about this to Ofcom? Anyone, please advice .",Anoop,GB,2025-06-04T14:20:18.000Z

1,"Ok, so whilst this seems a great deal, despite promises, Vodafone do not contact you to let you know your deal is about to end. In 2 months my Broadband increased from just under ¬£12 to ¬£37, however, due to DD payment dates, I realised on day of Mays payment it had increased and was already into Junes payment, over 200% increase. I have spent over a week and 2 hours on the phone trying to rectify this, however, you are totally reliant one ""special"" department contacting you...... they haven't.  This is disgraceful Vodafone.",Sam Woods,GB,2025-06-03T19:54:18.000Z

1,"The Vodafone Installations Team have not been helpful when I switched to Vodafone and had a problem with Openreach. They seemed content to do nothing even when I stated that Openreach had offered to see if they could expedite the problem. Whoever I spoke to at Vodafone would not let me speak to the Installations Team, they spoke to them and parroted back the date I was given, NOT bothering to contact Openreach. Vodafone think that more digging needs to be done, I can see the roll of cable already in my porch.  I signed up on April 9th, was given an installation date of May 6th. A problem with the conduit meant that I went into the 3-week wait till next visit by the civils team - great people and they seemed to fix it, just that Vodafone don't seem to have bothered to update anything - ""fob him off, we don't want to chase anything"" seems to be the team motto. I can't decide whether to ditch the lot or persevere as they are alleged to have a better signal, and I guess that's what they depend on, never mind customer service.  So still no Broadband since April 12th.",Mr Mitchell,GB,2025-06-03T17:48:16.000Z

I've never heard anything so ludicrous in my life and which you wouldn't get from 02 or EE. Totally unprofessional and unhelpful and was quite rude to me about it.Does the CEO of Vodafone know what the Customer Service Desk is doing?Go elsewhere but don't use Vodafone!!",Anon,GB,2025-06-03T12:41:53.000Z

2,"Today, while on my way to do my grocery shopping, I came across a distressed woman‚Äîshe was homeless and had special needs. She couldn‚Äôt top up her phone and didn‚Äôt understand why. I checked the phone for her: the device was working fine and could dial out, but none of the top-up service numbers were functioning.After a quick search, I saw a surge in complaints about Vodafone outages. It looked like whatever issue was affecting your systems had also taken out the top-up service.This woman was already going through a lot‚Äîher husband had recently passed away, and she was trying to sort out essential things like medical appointments and other urgent support. Being cut off from her only means of communication was the last thing she needed.I contacted Vodafone support using my own phone and waited 30 minutes before being transferred to the top-up line. The person I spoke to gave me a number, then immediately tried to end the call. I stopped her‚Äîafter waiting that long, I wasn‚Äôt going to be left without answers. But the number didn‚Äôt work. Neither of the two numbers she gave me worked.In the end, I used my own debit card to top up the woman‚Äôs phone, because there was no working way to do it otherwise.Please investigate this. Your system failure left a vulnerable person cut off and unsupported, and that‚Äôs not just a technical issue‚Äîit has real human consequences.",Yves Wheeler,GB,2025-06-02T23:14:33.000Z

1,"My husband and I decided  to switch to Vodafone for our broadband supplier and booked for installation on 22/5/25It‚Äôs now 2/6/25 and we have had no live broadband service as yet from them following this installation.Now spent a total of approx 4 hours on webchat with them (using mobile data as hey we don‚Äôt have broadband ü§î thanks to Vodafone.) also spent about an hour on telephone with them - still no further forward.  Missed the champions league final on tv, can‚Äôt stream tv, can‚Äôt work from home or check emails and no end in sight currently.  Running through data on phone to stay online as no other alternative.Had a communication from Vodafone on 23/5/25 apologising that broadband not working yet but not to do anything and they would sort it.  Waited 7 days and then we got in touch with them - if we hadn‚Äôt I am sure we would still be waiting on an update from them. I appreciate there are teething problems sometimes with a new service but the fact there has been no resolution and we are still waiting is not good enough.A communications company that can‚Äôt communicate with its customers doesn‚Äôt fill you with confidence - the fact that they can‚Äôt even guarantee connection on the webchat facility without you pressing a . every 60 seconds doesn‚Äôt again inspire confidence and competence with them.Wish we had stayed with our old supplier now",fiona mccallum,GB,2025-06-02T18:18:35.000Z

1,"Broadband - delays, wasted time and a lot of hard workOriginally signed up via an intermediary site that promised a voucher that never turned up. Service was delayed by 5 months as attempt after attempt to provide the service failed  and customer service was painful.When connected things were ok until I wanted to move. The service is run to minimise costs so ask the bot to speak to a person and it asks irrelevant questions.When you do speak to a person their scripts are too long winded and involve waiting while their machines process thingsIn the end they would not deliver the equipment without me attending a shop. It took 90 mins to get to that point & I wasn't going to take an afternoon of time just to prove who I amIf I never have to speak to Vodafone it'll be too soon",Mike W,GB,2025-06-02T16:05:56.000Z

1,I ordered fibre broadband from Vodafone on 29/11/2024. It is now June 2025 and I am still not connected. Their complaints service is next to useless - you communicate with a customer service centre that has no idea what is going on and no idea how to resolve problems. They ignore specific questions and request for escalation. They say it's not their fault or Openreach's fault but because civils are required to bring the line from the other side of the street so surveys are required by Openreach. In fact Openreach have 3 times sent people to carry out a survey and come up with a solution for connection. $ times Openreach have sent people to connect my home to the line that they haven't put in yet.Vodafone seem to have no basic service level agreement with Openreach or are not enforcing it. On the positive side they have sent me two broadband routers!,Iain Hill,GB,2025-06-02T13:26:29.000Z

1,Vodafone Broadband. Simple house move and attempt to have broadband reconnected at new address. All records held by Vodafone incorrect or out of date. Reconnection cancelled by Vodafone with no notice whatsoever; had to call to find out it had been cancelled. All records again incorrect having apparently been corrected when reconnection booked. Woeful. Avoid!,Richard Brown,GB,2025-06-02T12:10:34.000Z
1,"Contacted for an up to date delivery date for broadband router. For most companies this requires confirmation of a few details e.g. order number, post code, etc. and admittedly I should have been more prepared with details to hand. However, for Vodafone you have to even recall the last contact you had with them and whether this was over chat, email or phone. The whole process must have taken around 30 minutes. Had to wait a long time between responses from Vodafone customer service agent and was given many non-responses and time fillers e.g. ""I am checking the details"" which likely meant ""I am helping another customer"". Every time my connection dropped slightly I received a  reply saying they had not heard from me in quite some time despite me having to wait a long time between their responses. Let's just hope the broadband is better than their customer service so I don't have to contact them again.  Would not recommend using the chat service at all if possible and next time I will phone but for people who rely on chat for accessibility reasons this would not be possible. I think I've unfortunately passed the 14 day cooling off period as my soonest activation date and delivery date were a long time from my order date otherwise I would probably be cancelling my order and going with another provider.",Jessica Murray,GB,2025-06-02T12:08:23.000Z

1,"New switch to Vodafone - took months to connect up, which wasn't an issue for me as understood they needed to connect the line in under a road. However then my issues started, on switch day the new router didn't work and they turned the previous supplier off so left me without the internet for a work day (and I work from home) They had to post a new router out which needed to be signed for, however they did not understand that being in to sign for this when I had to do 5 hour round trip to the office to be able to work, was not understood. Just over 2 weeks later, no internet on Saturday but then came back and started working this morning ok and now it's gone again - they need to send an Openreach engineer, coming tomorrow - no internet again and over an hour on the phone to them, absolutely awful service and wishing I'd never switched to them, customer service is appalling!",suzanne Kissane,GB,2025-06-02T11:18:03.000Z

I spent a couple of hours troubleshooting it without a resolution, It has been escalated to the ""network team' twice (they closed the first ticket off without any communication).  I got them to open another ticket and they have requested screenshots of my phone screen and postcode of where I was at the time, I sent 2 over and now they say they need 3 screenshots with exact times, oh and I can only send them over betwen Thursday and Sunday!?? Are Vodafone a Mickey Mouse company now?  They have now closed off the second ticket!! I cant help feeling they dont really want to help and they know there is a wider issue since the 3G service was switched off.

1,"Engineer came and drilled through a pipe, lots of water and damage.  Lost access to a room in my home for nearly a month, had to take lots of time out so I could be there for lots of additional appointments and spend my own money for paint and cleaning products.  It took 3 further appointments just to get the broadband on.  Then when raising a complaint, Vodafone take no ownership, close my complaint and leave me waiting on the third party engineers to recognise a complaint despite my contract being with them.  Possibly the worst choice of provider, definitely not one click switch.",nicholas stewart,GB,2025-05-31T17:07:33.000Z

1,"We have experienced multiple issues with Vodafone broadband and the final nail in the coffin is them terminating the wrong line meaning we are unable to work. Apparently it will take 2 weeks to reinstate. The problem before that was when we terminated a line and they continued to take our money for months. We have lost hours on the phone to incompetent agents, time we will never get back and was a complete waste of time. The broadband service itself was pretty unreliable so this is the end!",Eva Fryer,GB,2025-05-31T16:04:35.000Z

1,"I contacted Vodafone after closing my bank account and asked them to cancel the direct debit as the account no longer exists. They refused. I tried again a few days later and explained as if I was talking to a child that it would cause problems with my payment if the direct debit is attempted.They again refused to cancel the direct debit. This went on for multiple phone calls and multiple complaints.The direct debit was taken out of the closed bank account indicating the payment was made. I made a manual payment.The direct debit was then returned to the bank in question. The next day I get a text and email saying my bill is unpaid. Now they are saying I haven't made my bill payment and I have to pay them again. If I don't my account will be restricted and I'll receive late payment fees.So, I explain the bank account in question is closed. I explain that the direct debit will fail and cause me to have a late payment or it'll cause problems with the manual payment. Yet they knowingly refuse to act accordingly putting my finances, and communications at risk. The company hasn't changed in 15 years. Still thieves and liars.I would strongly recommend anyone considering joining Vodafone looks for a different communication provider. Vodafone will destroy your credit score, they will destroy your mental health, they will destroy your life. And they will make you pay for the privilege.Got a text at 6.45 This morning saying I'd get a callback between 12 and 2 today. It goes past 2pm and I call to find out what happened. Only to be told the agent who text me isn't at work today. The whole company is absolutely useless. Full of liars and thieves.I've wasted all the time I'm prepared. If my problem isn't fixed today I'll close my accounts. I'm not dealing with thieves and liars",Philip Marshall,GB,2025-05-31T13:35:35.000Z

1,Extremely dissapointed with the service. I had taken out an online package with Vodafone on the 13th April. I had been promised an engineer would attend my property as soon as possible. It is now the 30th May and I still haven't had my Internet activated. They gave me an appointment on the 28th May with an engineer for a home visit. I stayed home the whole day and nobody showed up. They had called me today with excuses and justifications. I was told The next available engineer would be able to come on the 11th July. Very unhappy with Vodafone for wasting my time and energy.

1,20 yrs ago Vodafone screwed me.  They haven't changed. My husband decided to leave Vodafone for a better deal. He was paying over ¬£20 for a SIM card only. They kept on asking for more and more information due to 'security'. They cut him off so he couldn't use his phone because of security. We had to ring an 0333 number. We were on the phone 1 HR and 30 mins due to the their incompetency. I've just discovered we have been charged ¬£4.50 for that pleasure.

1,"I ordered a new phone on their website for delivery 2 days later. I had to contact them 2 days later as I hadn‚Äôt received any further communication and they promised I‚Äôd hear back within 48 hours. After 48 hours I contacted them again as I still hadn‚Äôt received any communication and I was told the phone was ‚Äòstuck‚Äô at the warehouse but that they ‚Äòguarantee‚Äô I‚Äôll hear from them within 7 days‚Ä¶ contacted them again 8 days later as I still hadn‚Äôt received any contact at all from them and was told the order had to be cancelled because the warehouse didn‚Äôt receive the signed plan - the same signed plan I was sent via email on the day I ordered. Even when I offered to send them the signed document they had sent me with the time stamp of the day of purchase they couldn‚Äôt accept. Clearly some issues with their warehouse and sales/website not communicating and a complete void of any customer service as not once have I been contacted to apologise for the inconvenience of not receiving my order or having to contact them to find out what‚Äôs happening rather than the other way around. Anyway, can‚Äôt place the same order from them for another 24 hours whilst the other one is cancelled, plenty of time to look elsewhere!",Matthew Philpott,GB,2025-05-30T16:59:04.000Z

Instead of receiving the usual Vodafone confirmation I  received one from ''prepaidmobilerecharge.com'' On checking I discovered the the original balance had disappeared and my balance was ¬£10. Was I scammed. On speaking with Vodafone it turned out that because another company used what appeared to be the official Vodafone  web site I had been tricked into giving scammers my Debit card details. Posting my complaint on to the scam website ''prepaidmobilerecharge.com''my rating was changed from 1 Star to 4 stars,Colin Fellows,GB,2025-06-03T16:14:55.000Z
1,"I‚Äôm one of those people that chop and change broadband providers to get a good deal so I went with Vodafone despite reading bad reviews, thinking ‚Äò they‚Äôre a big company I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be fine‚Äô.I was wrong.Customer service is terrible, impossible to get hold of ( one time over an hour and a half on hold and still no answer). Total incompetence from staff as well, one will say one thing and you‚Äôll get past around from one department to another and the next person will contradict the previous person on what is causing an issue ect. I spent over 3 hours one night trying to get our internet working after activation after a house move and it was painful tbh. I got nowhere and in the end I gave up. I tried again the next night on their Tobi online chat and this time I was hit with different reasons as to why it was still not working. Again no connection. At this point I went on my sky app to go back with them as I‚Äôd had enough, so then tried to leave Vodafone which was also ridiculously impossible. Was I at the beginning of a contact as I‚Äôd just moved or was I still on monthly rolling as I‚Äôd been with them nearly two years? Again I was getting mixed messages from Vodafone with one person saying one thing and the next one saying the opposite. It was almost like a wind up the service was so bad.I was also told  that the 3 weeks I wasn‚Äôt receiving any service after moving house that I would not be getting changed, but guess what? They did charge me the full amount!In the end, in their compete and utter uselessness they mucked up in my favour as on the third consecutive night of phoning them I actually spoke to a ‚ÄòSamantha‚Äô who tbh was the only decent staff member I dealt with. While on the phone basically pleading with her to just cancel my service so I could go elsewhere she mentioned I took out my contract with them  STARTING IN DECEMBER 2025 when we were still in MAY 2025! I told her to repeat what she just said and as she was doing so stopped mid sentence and realised the total ball‚Äôs up in apparently starting a contract in the future. This was my get out as the contract was null and void and she agreed to cancel my contract immediately! Phew!! Samantha admitted she had no idea how that had happened, and it was for me at least my get out from the worst service by a country mile I‚Äôve ever encountered from any company regardless of size let alone a big one like Vodafone.TLTR. Don‚Äôt be like me and ignore the negative reviews like I did, thinking you‚Äôll be ok. You won‚Äôt.",Aaron Hudson,GB,2025-05-29T21:05:59.000Z

1,"They sold me fibre 150 which guaranteed at least 75mb but i never get anything above 40mb.  They use the excuse that they can only guarantee speeds if your connected via cable which nobody can really do as most routers are in a cupboard in a hallway.  They then have the cheek to offer you booster boxes which would increase your bill and if you want to cancel its over ¬£100 so your basically trapped with rubbish internet. Dont get me started on customer service, yes you will always get through to someone after waiting but they never offer you a solution and talk to you like your a child after jumping through hoop after hoop before you even get to speak about your issue.",Mark Miller,GB,2025-05-29T20:25:18.000Z
1,"Back in January I spoke to Vodafone as I had changed jobs and my pay day meant I would have to change my payment date to 1st of each month, they confirmed it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and due to billing cycle wouldn‚Äôt take affect until March. Spoke to Vodafone today as my direct debit was meant to be taken on 1st of each month, explained they took the bill early which has meant I have gone overdrawn (pay day is tomorrow) Spent two long hours on the phone and I was told it was mistake their end but it‚Äôs impossible to move billing cycle so I should have never been told the 1st is ok. By way of recompense they offered ¬£5 Morrisons voucher. I explained this should never have happened and the overdraft fee alone would be more than this paltry amount. The lady disappeared and offered a ¬£10 e voucher on her return. Each time she said that it was the best she could do. Clearly both were lies! So even though it‚Äôs Vodafone mess up nothing was offered as fair compensation. Luckily I‚Äôm out of fixed contracts with Vodafone and have moved all my accounts elsewhere which is a shame as I had been with them for the better part of 18 years. After numerous mess ups over the years this was the final straw. They did offer to match what I had found but still couldn‚Äôt move my direct debit to the 1st of each mont, had they been able to do that I would have been tempted to stay. After testing my wired/wifi connection also turns out I‚Äôm getting less than their minimum guaranteed! (I have gigafast package) Also the lack of 5g in my area is also annoying. I feel Vodafone can and should be doing more for their loyal customers.",Leigh Mcshane,GB,2025-05-29T19:17:03.000Z

1,"I am constantly having slower broadband speeds than I have been guaranteed in my contract. I go through Vodaphones trouble shooting process which always comes back to say my internet is fine although when I have done speed tests on my phone or Xbox they are around 125mps slower than my guaranteed lowest speed. You then try to talk to an actual human and very conveniently the website will freeze and none of the buttons will do anything. I can't be the only one this happens to and what I don't understand is how they just get away with it by ignoring you.

Five days before my contract was due to expire I was phoned by an aggressive, rude salesman (he certainly had not undertaken customer service training) to renew my contract.

5,"I spent days trying to collect a Gigacube router ordered via chat, however due to a typo added by the operator, IDV check failed at the store and I could not collect it. Surprisingly, no one at Vodafone could fix my name in my account. The only option was for me to submit a name change request which required the account number which I still didn't have since it was not activated yet. So basically I got locked out and no one could sort it out at Vodafone and the only option (less stressful) was to let the order expire and be canceled.Hopefully, I went to Vodafone Covent Garden to re-order it where I was assisted by Huseyin and Qasim who went above and beyond to ensure I had my plan placed and internet activated. I highly recomment reaching out to them, especially Qasim who overcame system's limitations to ensure my problem was resolved.

He took great trouble to make sure that the new IPhone 16 was user ready and more importantly new user understood and was both charming and extremely patient with 2 elderly women.

As said a quite exceptional level of customer care and service.",Morrison,GB,2025-05-28T16:57:13.000Z

1,Ordered a Vodafone 150 broadband package. On the day of connection I plugged in the power and ethernet cable as directed. It wouldn't connect. Couldn't speak to anyone directly so spent the next 6 hours on web chats. First 3 agents disappeared and the last one didn't inspire confidence. I had to cancel and go to new supplier. Vodafone back up was pathetic and they need to allow agents to converse in order to resolve. Never again!!,Joe Kelly,GB,2025-05-28T15:36:41.000Z

1,"I've been with Vodafone for some time now and I really can't wait to get out of my contract so I can find another provider. This has got to be the worst broadband I've had and I thought virgin media was bad! My broadband keeps dropping out, I've lost service for multiple weeks throughout the year which means I've had loss of income due to losing our on work (which Vodafone have NOT reimbursed me for). I can't stream without there being some kind of connection issues.nive spoken to multiple agents at the company all of which have no idea what they're doing! The last agent I spoke to transferred me to about 3 or 4 different people and I ended up with someone trying to sign me up as a new customer!!! Absolute shambles! Any review telling you Vodafone is the best overall provider must be lying. If I was you, I'd avoid at all costs. For a company that is legally contracted to provide a paid service, they do the complete opposite. I'm going to call Vodafone and demand they cancel the contract on their behalf due to their failure of providing the service I'm paying for!",MR,GB,2025-05-27T22:51:16.000Z

If it was a third party and not Vodafone how on earth did they know my Vodafone account number? Vodafone now refusing to cancel the contract unless I pay an early termination of ¬£56.

1,"This has been a terrible experience with Vodafone. I needed to move home while still under contract with them. I called more than two weeks before my moving date to arrange broadband activation at my new address. The customer service representative assured me that someone would come to install and activate the broadband on the scheduled day.However, no one showed up, and I received no communication or updates. I then called customer service and spent over an hour on the phone. The representative promised that her manager would call me back within 24 to 48 hours ‚Äî but, once again, no one followed through.After five days without internet and no updates, I called again. This time, someone based in the UK informed me that the installation had been rescheduled for more than a week later. I requested compensation, as I would be without internet for almost half a month while still being charged the full monthly fee. The customer service agent, however, made every excuse to avoid offering any compensation.It was only after I mentioned reporting the issue to Ofcom that the agent finally took the matter seriously and said she would check for an earlier installation date. The new date is now six days away, but I have still received no compensation for being without internet for over 10 days ‚Äî not to mention the stress and frustration of dealing with their customer service.This has been a dreadful experience. I used to live in the U.S., and people often complained about AT&T ‚Äî a provider I used for many years. But compared to Vodafone, AT&T feels like an angel. I will I will report my case to Ofcom anyway.",Jason,GB,2025-05-27T15:51:49.000Z

I did not realise that, in the world of Vodafone, this constituted an 'upgrade' and therefore a new contract. I found a much better deal at ¬£5 per month and now have a termination fee of ¬£361 to pay!! Since they were charging me for needless insurance I think they owe me.

5,"What a difference it is to get great customer service! I've always preferred to speak to someone face to face instead of using call centres. I went to Vodafone Merry Hill as I was interested in swapping to their broadband but had questions that needed answers. Step forward Ryan, who was a star! He knew exactly what I needed and explained how full fibre would be installed. I definitely didn't want my drive dug up, and it won't be. Ryan went out of his way for us, and evengot us a much better deal on our mobiles. He swapped us from our old provider, got the PAC codes, I didn't have to do a thing. Highly recommended store and staff. The following day I was going to swop my phone using Samsung Switch only to find that my Samsung phone didn't support it! Went back to Vodafone Merry Hill to see Ryan, who was busy at the time, but another member of staff sorted the phone in minutes. You are genuinely in safe hands!

1,"My Internet didn't work for 3 months, going through vodafone phone system to try and resolve the issue is unbearable, everytime on hold for at least 45min before anyone picks up only to be transferred from department to department. Every question I asked involves me being put on hold for 20min wile they have to ask someone else for an answer. Everything I told them about the Internet not working involves them having to tell someone else and again being put on hold for another 20min. OUTRAGEOUS!!!Once the problem was raised they send me a txt message in the evening saying the problem had been resolved when it haven't. So the next day I had to do it all again, for 3 months. The total time I was on the phone to them was well over 40hours. OUTRAGEOUS!!! I have been through terrible phone systems before from other companies but nothing even comes close to how bad vodafone are. During the 3 months my Internet didn't work they never forgot to charge me. Eventually after 3 months they got my Internet working, I asked them about getting a refund, they said I get a refund for the period of time my Internet was down but it won't be applied to my account for 2 months, 3 months later I was still being charged, I rang them again to ask why? Another 45min just to get through to someone, everything I asked involves me being put on hold for 15min to get an answer, eventually they said I was owed a refund and can I stay on hold wile they calculated it, it took over an hour to work out apparently because my Internet was down for so long only for them to say I'm not getting any refund. I asked why? Another 15min on hold to be told because I missed 1 call from them (because I was at work and couldn't pick up my phone) that is enough of a reason for them to say I delayed the process. I asked when was this call? Another 20min on hold to be told it was 2 months into my Internet being down. So no refund even for the 2 months before this apparently phone call, OUTRAGEOUS!!! And that's all they need to deny you any refund at all for not providing a service there charging you for.If you speak to vodafone wanting to take out a contract you go through to an English call centre, if you have a problem you go though to an Indian call centre, where the hold times are insane OUTRAGIOUS!!! Like I said total time I was on the phone to vodafone was over 40 hours and probably more like 60hours. I've never known anything like it.",Chris,GB,2025-05-26T17:00:26.000Z

2,Having been a loyal customer of Vodafone went to the Store to ask for a new phone. There was a complete misunderstanding. I wanted a new contract new number NOT the upgrade that I was given. This misunderstanding had caused a lot of stress . I had to phone yesterday which took over an hour to sort. I've had to order a new sim card for more money over 18 months now  .An adjustment has been made to my device now for more money which I didn't even want  just total confusion and frustration. I'm considering leaving Vodafone at the earliest opportunity now,sarah ianson,GB,2025-05-26T10:36:07.000Z
1,Absolutely atrocious. I switched my roaming off on a holiday to American as I had purchased an esim from a much cheaper provider. I must not have switched the roaming off correctly as it charged me three times my monthly bill. I contacted Vodafone as soon as I got home and they said to get back to them after the bill is generated (which I did today!) Spoke to them today and was told they wouldn't help me out with a genuine mistake and it was completely my fault! Genuinely surprised at how unsupportive they were with this genuine mistake. Made no attempt to help at all. I'll be leaving as soon as possible.,Sam,GB,2025-05-26T09:37:26.000Z

1,"Location: Cambridgelets start about a year ago, and everywhere I went around Cambridge and the surrounding areas I was struggling to get a signal on vodafone. I called and they ran me through the usual of getting the most up to date carrier settings for my phone (this was repeated many times I called vodafone), but this did not fix the issue. The phone was not the issue as I bought a Pixel 9 and experienced the same issue.I had a strong signal (full 4G) but I could not get and bandwidth and it became so bad that at around 4-6pm, if I wanted to make a call, I would have to disable 4G to actually make a call.I reported all this to vodafone, but nobody on the team could understand the difference between signal and bandwidth.Fast forward to just recently, and I called asking to cancel my contract, at first they tried to run me through troubleshooting, then asking what I had been offered in other places, and after 20 minutes of me refusing to answer their questions and just asking to cancel my contract, they put the phone down.I called again very angry and luckily had somebody that just processed the cancellation with no questions, however it took over 30 minutes to do this.Not had any issues on EE yet, but I will not be touching Vodafone againEdit: I'm gone, you can't get me back. Do better with the customers you have and train your staff to understand why a client might get no data despite having full signal. I won't be wasting anymore time talking to your poor customer support",Ben,GB,2025-05-25T20:04:02.000Z

I had to spend 2 hours on the phone to them to get them to obey it.Then they billed me for the service I had cancelled and told me that they would refund it to me the following month.Then they did not actually refund me the money they owed me.  I had to spend another 40 minutes demanding that they give me my money back, and then they told me that they would only refund me in June.",Stuart Barrett,GB,2025-05-25T14:51:33.000Z

When I tried to complaint, they put me on hold for 3 hours and would not let me complaint. Then put on pay as you go. Now they are trying to charge me ¬£600.00 for them moving me from a contract to pay as you go. If you use VODAFONE move to ANYONE ELSE ASAP.Dear Vodafone, So rather than you contact me you want me to try contacting you again? I dont use Facebook or X, is there a number (not 3 hours via you call centres) that I can call you or someone who can resolve this in minutes not hours?

1,"Excellent, so good and honest. The best experience I've had in mobile phone shop.Update: I was told phone number would change over by 4pm Tuesday. Still not changed by this evening Wednesday. Phoned the customer service and was told the request had not been actioned. So they had to do this today so will not be able to use phone until Fri/ Sat. A full week after purchase so told customer advisor that I was paying under 2 contracts due to their error, told to take it up with the shop as it was my word and I cannot prove it as they have no record! üò° So basically called a liar. Then thought maybe I should double check the package I've been sold. Went onto my vodaphone could not access, they asked for a password. Never had one so. Tried to set up a new account for it to stare I already had one. So clicked on forgot password. Came up that an email has been sent to my email but the email address doesn't exist or if it does, does not belong to me which is worrying that my data could be breached. So I phone again to be told they cannot amend my email address. I now have to go back to the shop on Saturday to sort it. Absolutely fuming!! üò°üò°",Sharon Whittall,GB,2025-05-28T20:19:13.000Z

1,"I would have given a zero star rating if possible, and that would have been more than the company deserves. They are utterly useless. We have been experiencing problems with them for a while and my partner just switched to another company with a PAYG SIM to escape them. We could not use their app, or even get the money they kept taking from us translated into phone credit. We have still not been able to get them to close the account, and they continue to take money. We have had to close our Bank Account to stop them taking money. It is causing other problems now because the new bank account with another company is not yet up and running.In short, Vodafone are a bunch of clowns! Avoid them at all costs.",STEPHEN LOCKLEY,GB,2025-05-23T22:03:39.000Z

1,"I made a decision to switch from current BB provider to Vodafone after reading reviews. Ordered the home BB service on 9th May 2025 via Uswitch link as they were offering a ¬£90 gift card reward.Received email confirmation and chose installation date as Thursday 29th May. Email stated that equipment would arrive 3 working days before installation date which I realised would be a bank holiday Monday.I called up to enquire about the installation only to be informed that the order had been cancelled without any explanation. First customer service staff member blamed uSwitch and said they had cancelled.I emailed uSwitch and they responded promptly saying they did not store any information on their systems as all information and order would have been processed and credit checks done through the Vodafone website.I called customer service again. This time it was a lady on the phone who checked account again and informed me that the order had been cancelled and the account was credit check pending. Lady offered to reorder which I declined as that meant I would lose out on the ¬£90 cash back offer from uSwitch.Within the last two weeks there was no communication via email or phone to inform me of the status of my order. I only learnt of the outcome when I phoned up.And now seeing there are 30% complaints with customers leaving 1 start reviews, I am contemplating of remaining with my current home BB provider.",Sohail Anjum,GB,2025-05-23T20:00:55.000Z

Only to recieve more emails saying the account was active. Called to check, only to be told i would now be liable for 'early termination fees' even though i was within the 14 day cool off period & the device never worked.

1,"Vodafone has delivered, without a doubt, the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever encountered. I‚Äôve been a customer for over six months, and during this time, I‚Äôve been completely unable to access my account. This has prevented me from resetting up a direct debit, which has led to overcharge and unjustified late fees.I‚Äôve spent more than four hours on the phone with their support team, being bounced around between departments, only to be told time and again that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing they can do.‚Äù Not only have they failed to fix the issue, they refuse to take responsibility or even remove the fees caused by their own broken systems. They also refuse to transfer me to their managers. The only thing vodafone proposes to its clients is to pay more, for an unexistant service.The level of incompetence and indifference is staggering. Vodafone clearly has no interest in helping their customers, resolving issues, or even providing basic functionality. It‚Äôs astonishing that a major telecom company can operate with such a blatant disregard for its customers.I will be filing a formal complaint with the Communication & Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS). If you‚Äôre considering Vodafone‚Äîdon‚Äôt. Spare yourself the stress and look elsewhere.Edit: the late fee has been cancelled after 2h30 on the phone. But I am still not able to connect to my account.",reviewer,FR,2025-05-23T13:33:11.000Z

1,You can only cancel your plan one time of year. If you cancel outside of this window you have to pay for the remaining year. What a scam. I have been a loyal customer for more than 10 years and now I have moved away from the uk and have to pay for a plan I have no use for for 7 months.,AnneSofie,GB,2025-05-23T09:55:04.000Z

1,"I recently joined Vodafone but am beginning to regret this decision. I changed bank current accounts which resulted in a direct debit for Vodafone not being transferred over. As soon as they alerted me to this fact I set up anew one the same day. Despite this I was charged a fee by Vodafone for payment being less than a week late. I tried to query Vodafone‚Äôs eagerness to charge a fee but I found to my cost that their customer service is woeful. There is no way to email Vodafone, instead you are directed to a totally inept web chat that I assume is manned by poorly trained call centre staff working from a script. Vodafone appear to copying Amazon‚Äôs lead by making it difficult to lodge a formal complaint in the hope that people will just give up. I have emailed Vodafone‚Äôs CEO to pass on my complaint but it seems that he too is not interested in dealing with adverse customer feedback. As yet I‚Äôve had no reply.I would advise anyone to avoid Vodafone and will be changing provider as soon as my contract is up.I‚Äôm sure that I will get a generic response from Vodafone directing me to a Facebook page if I wish to discuss the matter further. I do not, nor do I wish to join Facebook.",Paul,GB,2025-05-22T22:49:55.000Z

1,"For 2 months I have been waiting for new connection, after 3 weeks of waiting , no one turned up, no one even bothered to inform me, they told me it was cancelled because of a problem with my previous provider BT, 6 weeks later an enginner came and installed a new socket and received the router but the openreach enginner told me there is a ""blockage"" in the street which would be fixed in few days and I would have connection but again no one came, no one fixed, still no connection, rang Vodafone many times who seem clueless and don't care, they connected me to agents in North Africa who seemed equally clueless, amazing, if I had known this I would never have joined Vodafone, 2 months later still no connection, vodafone make me wait long time to talk to someone only for that person to make wait ages so he can talk to another person, sometimes they never come back, there is NO customer support or complaint email address, amazing, NO, on top I have heath issues and have to deal with this crap, shame on you Vodafone, waisted so much time for NOTHING.

1,"After over 25 plus years with VF firstly my name then my wife took over account (keeping same number and contract). she was contacted to say changing plan as it was old. The new plan was much worse. Spoke with a VF rep on live chat and was offered very poor deal. Loyalty does not pay I would urge all VF customers to check Uswitch for a fairer deal.UpdateCalled back on the number provided by Social media team. VF rep was nice but useless still the same deal offered so loyalty does not pay. Tried to put us off using an MVNO as it wasn't premium. Then told her of a Uswitch offer with Three . She then proceeded to tell us they weren't that good.......very strange we told her as VF and Three are to merge shortly. After stumbling around a bit we thanked her and the call ended. I suggest all VF customers vote with their feet and leave, as I stated earlier you aren't valued sadly.",Halcyon days,GB,2025-05-23T13:22:57.000Z

1,"‚ÄúFacebook‚Äôs ‚ÄòSupport‚Äô is a Joke ‚Äì No Resolution, Endless Neglect!‚Äù  Despite repeatedly explaining my problem via chat (with an actual human agent!), Facebook has done absolutely nothing to resolve it. I‚Äôve been complaining since yesterday, and instead of action, I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of incompetence. Their own staff said I want be charged but they charged me and now they are still waiting for final bill. Vodafone Stole my money. And there are liers in customer service call. They are made to lie to customer by Vodafone.The So-Called ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù: No urgency: After 24+ hours, they still ask for my name and mobile number‚Äì details I‚Äôve already provided MULTIPLE times.  -Zero progress: Agents acknowledge the complaint but refuse to escalate or fix anything. It‚Äôs like talking to a brick wall.  -Negligence:  My case is clearly being ignored. Their team prioritizes stalling over solving.  Final Thoughts:This isn‚Äôt just bad service ‚Äì it‚Äôs willful neglect. If Facebook can‚Äôt handle basic complaints without stonewalling customers, they shouldn‚Äôt offer ‚Äúsupport‚Äù at all.  Warning to Others: ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid relying on Facebook for anything requiring customer care. You‚Äôll waste hours repeating yourself, only to be ghosted.  To Facebook:Train your team to stop asking for the same info and actually resolve issues. This disrespectful runaround is how you alienate users for good.",Naman Bhandari,GB,2025-05-22T18:32:10.000Z

If I moved to a different Location with my phone, service was normal.To get rid of me, she offered to send replacement Sim cards for the two phones we have. Guess what? No improvement.I am now a Three customer. Voda has utterly lost the plot. I‚Äôm an I.T. Techie myself, and I can tell you the technical reason for the failure was never addressed.

He said he would get my account cancelled and process my complaint and ensure i do not recieve any more payment requests. He even said there would be financial compensation for the extreamly poor customer service i had recieved and all of the difficulties i had trying to resolve the issue.I never recieved a call back and i‚Äôve now had an email requesting the funds again. I‚Äôm now having to call back again, and i‚Äôm on hold to someone else who is investigating the issue for the second time.It‚Äôs simple, i cancelled my service so it ended on the last day i occupied the property.

Over 2 hours of online chat and I still don't know when the phone will arrive.I do know it would take 3 days to cancel the order which hasn't even left. I know that if I'd ordered the phone from Samsung directly I'd already have it.All I want is the phone I ordered to be sent and it seems in a world where I can receive my groceries within an hour , vodafone just can't keep upDissappointed just doesn't cut it.",Fiona Kessell-Holland,GB,2025-05-21T23:29:06.000Z

1,"Used to be the best, now just being bad on purpose I suspect to maintain revenue.I can‚Äôt manage my family‚Äôs phone accounts in one place anymore in preparation for a holiday.The app is designed to frustrate, it used to be good, then it got worse, now it‚Äôs a joke.Basic tasks like logging out, changing spend caps, or managing bolt ons are buried under vague menus or outright blocked or hidden. Want to switch between numbers? Good luck. There‚Äôs no logout button, just a digital hostage situation.Tobi, the so-called chatbot, is less ‚ÄúAI assistant‚Äù and more a geriatric bingo caller throwing random words at your questions.Want to use the support pages? You may as well ask your pet dog to search for the answer.Every update seems designed to remove features, not improve them. The app routinely redirects you to broken web pages, freezes on load, or loops endlessly between logins.This isn‚Äôt a service tool anymore. It‚Äôs a revenue-l preservation device masquerading as an app. Designed to frustrate, And it‚Äôs working, because I‚Äôm finally giving up and changing provider after 20+ years as a Vodafone customer.",Joe Dickson,GB,2025-05-21T20:46:14.000Z

1,Update on Vodafone service. Having waited since January 23 to activate broadband and telephone to the home of a severely disabled elderly lady I can report that the router has been installed in a location that conflicts with published instruction issued by Vodafone. Unable to connect her devices the help of the Vodafone  Bridgwater shop said ‚ÄúVodafone operatives aren‚Äôt insured to enter customers homes‚Äù. As I‚Äôm advised that subcontractors conduct Vodafone installations it surely follows that they too aren‚Äôt insured. Should you have challenging health condition do NOT rely on this company for assistance as you will be disappointed. How then when requested to assist disabled people who need assistance connecting devices do they serve all customers if they aren‚Äôt insured to enter your home? It appears that Vodafone is just a name and all actual work is conducted using subcontractors. Forget this company if you need any assistance due to personal circumstances and or assistance as they aren‚Äôt interested.,Colin,GB,2025-05-21T19:42:19.000Z

1,Getting through to Vodafone is a real pain. it has taken 1 1/2 hours to sort out how to get signed on to my account. Half spent dealing with a useless chat bot and two with a human who couldn't help. When I signed in it sent an SMS to my landline with a signon code which said 'zero minutes'. It turns out they cannot send SMS to a landline so why did they allow me to attach my landline in the first place! The chatbot was useless and the human wasn't much help. after 30 minutes they told me I failed security so had to go to a store. Another wait and it took 20 minutes to get it sorted. Vodafone is another robotic company when if your query doesn't fit with their program you get no where. If I could have e-mailed them I would not have had to hang on.,Richard Wilcock,GB,2025-05-21T19:04:34.000Z

Absolutely disgusting and dishonest. Avoid Vodafone Grantham.Thank you to Vodafone social media team's response inviting me to DM them. How do I do that? No email address, no hashtag, no mobile number to text to. Doesn't look like a serious effort to put right the problem. In addition to all of the above, Vodafone Grantham have initiated a transfer of my Father's old number to Vodafone. So we are about to loose that as well.

1,Broadband not working from 16th May and no one has sorted the issue. Worst customer support. We had to take cabs for work and paying ¬£8 per day for EE wifi Already costed us ¬£90 and maybe it goes on. Worst service ever,Bharath Chand,GB,2025-05-21T12:59:03.000Z

1,"I would give 0 stars if I could! I have had non stop problems with Vodafone. Staff extremely unhelpful and argue back with you. I have a flag on my account because I am autistic and I struggle with my finances and have explained on multiple occasions I need them to be clear and direct with me. Is this ever the case? No. Live chat is completely worthless, takes nearly an hour to get something done every time. As soon as my contract is over, I will be going elsewhere and with my WIFI. The customer service is an absolute joke at this company and they do not care. I have never spoken to someone who hasn‚Äôt got a bad attitude, or who hasn‚Äôt argued back with me. Never spoken to anybody who is kind, compassionate or friendly. Disgusting company",Maddie Porter,GB,2025-05-21T12:47:54.000Z

2,"Process of moving contract and number over to Vodafone was lengthy and confusing. Lots of confusing jargon and missed information. Upon arriving to the store to collect my phone I was informed starling was not accepted which was not confirmed to me prior to the appointment, they then tried to upsell me lots of adds on for data stating that I didn‚Äôt have enough when I know full well that I have enough. When my number and contract were finally set up I was automatically subscribed to lots of extra add ons which I had to manually cancel but I find this a bit sleazy as it could easily be missed and recurring charges would be made. Not really too pleased and may be moving to another provider next time.",Eddie Hernandes,GB,2025-05-21T12:14:37.000Z

1,"I wanted to move my number to Vodafone. I went to a store, everything went well, and the porting was scheduled for the 19th of May. However, it wasn‚Äôt completed on time, nor two days later. I used the online chat service to ask why it wasn‚Äôt finished, but none of the agents could resolve the issue. They suggested I call another number, but I didn‚Äôt have time. The last agent then rescheduled another porting request for tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt think that will happen either. This is my second time trying to port my number in the UK, and both times have been disasters. And, because of this delay, I will be overcharged for using the other carrier without a plan.",Cenk,GB,2025-05-21T10:56:07.000Z

I explained that the bill was due on 21st May so why were they even badgering me but agent said no its due the 20th, i have bill saying 21st and text saying 21st but then asked to send them the proof the agent even tried to sell me something when i am trying to solve the issue, ended up ending the call because they were not interested in solving the issue. I always pay on time yet this month they worried they wont get their money, would i recommend nope not after the frustrating chat experience and guess what went on to my account and there it was you have paid your bill, an hour of my life i will never get back!",jane little,GB,2025-05-20T18:33:00.000Z

I returned a phone I had never even used and they charged me for 10 days line rental and then during the time I was challenging this they charged ¬£5 late payment fee.

1,"FTTP Broadband from Vodafone:I've just had a truly dreadful experience with Vodafone and thought I would warn others.My 1.6Gbps FTTP service was installed yesterday at the second attempt (8 days after it should have been). The service worked at the advertised speeds getting 1.6Gbps during the day and being throttled to their 'guaranteed minimum' 800Mbps later in the evening and through midnight and beyond.The issue is that the supplied Ultra Hub only has 1 x 2.5Gbps port (which is used for the ONT incoming fibre connection) and 4 x 1Gbps ports which obviously can't supply the 1.6Gbps I paid for to my wired 10Gbps intranet and BE85 WiFi7 mesh system.As I'm only on day 2 of the 'cooling off period' I tried to get Vodafone to simply swap the Router for the one they now include in the exact same 1.6Gbps package. Should have been easy, Right? Wrong! Chat to AI bot and then Agent last night got me nothing except 'call a number tomorrow'. I did. The first agent at least tried to be helpful but couldn't do what was needed. The second agent in termination/retentions frankly couldn't give a damn so I simply terminated the contract.I've now ordered a 1.6Gbps service from EE (who also guarantee a minimum 1.3Gbps which is much better than Vodafone's 800 minimum!).I only need a Hub that works and feeds into my existing intranet so customer service should not be needed (I've heard that EE aren't great either).I would now have to suggest very strongly that people avoid Vodafone based on my experience (as a pre-existing broadband user). I didn't have any problems with them before, but they failed me with what should have been a very simple replacement task.Obviously this speed issue only applies to plans above 1 Gbps, but I would also add that it was impossible to get the supplied WiFi Extender to pair, and I'm a computer geek having worked in the industry all my life. The pairing issue is apparently very common. Caveat Emptor!Edit: I reached out to Vodafone via Facebook messaging as requested in their response, went through the exact same process I'd previously already gone through 3 times today, and eventually got told to phone another landline number for an IMMEDIATE disconnect! I had requested Saturday midnight. Talk about adding insult to injury. I can only think they are trying to force me beyond the 14 day no cancellation fee deadline.Please note right here that I tried to cancel this 4 times today May 20th 2025 and I expect that request to be honored and no early termination fee charged!I was also unable to raise a formal complaint, but told the details for that were on their website!",Colin Dyckes,GB,2025-05-20T17:21:05.000Z

It‚Äôs an issue that had the multiple advisors I‚Äôve contacted actually listened, would have been fixed in 2 weeks at worst.As it stands after Openreach (who have been excellent) repaired the cable that had been cut during gas pipe replacement in my area, and leaving me just needing to have the cable reconnecting to my property. I have been unable to get Vodafone to arrange for this to happen. Because they have kept charging me! You get about ¬£9 a day compensation, so I am actually in credit by over ¬£500 currently.

That went as well as you can imagine.Upshot is when I move in the next few months, I will make it clear that the new occupant should choose Virgin or BT, cheap is cheap for a reason.Per the response, I gave you a rare second chance, I never give a third.",Karen Jones,GB,2025-05-19T18:48:31.000Z

1,"Zero is not available unfortunately. I have never had such a shockingly bad customer experience. I transferred my service to Vodafone broadband from Virgin Media in April. When it transferred I contacted Virgin to enquire about returning my equipment and was told my service hadn't been cancelled with them by Vodafone. Vodafone initially claimed that they couldn't tell Virgin even though they can tell other providers. Virgin claim this is totally incorrect. They blamed one another at this point. I spent many hours on phone and chat with both companies dealing with this and eventually was assured by Vodafone that they would cover the almost 7 weeks of charges from Virgin as I had to take on a cancellation period before disconnection. When I finally got my closing bill from Virgin I contacted Vodafone via chat as agreed by the agent who said they would cover my losses. Eventually I had to switch to a phone call after I had been cut off from chat 3 times. When I got through on the phone the agent disputed that they had agreed to pay the accrued costs even though I had it screenshotted and he could see it on my account. I then was caught in a hellscape of trying to a) get them to understand that it is not my problem if their colleague has given out the wrong information and b) once he acknowledged that they should honour their word, trying to upload my final bill via a simultaneous chat as they don't do email?!!! I began this interaction at 11.30 am and as I type  at 3.23pm I am not yet done. Interspersed with some human comments are the inevitable AI generated generic comments which are beyond annoying. Oh, and at one point the agent asked me to have some patience and 'Wait!' said in what can only be described as an exasperated fashion. He also at one point offered me and then withdrew the offer of a ¬£10 voucher as I am not a mobile customer! Surely you can do better than this Vodafone. I am sorely disappointed that I am now contracted to you for 18 months as frankly you don't deserve the business.",conradv,GB,2025-05-19T17:31:24.000Z

1,"19/05 - Dear Vodafone Customer Service,I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I have been receiving since switching to Vodafone.Ten days ago, I transferred from Virgin to Vodafone due to Virgin‚Äôs inability to provide internet services for 17 days. Unfortunately, my experience with Vodafone has not been any better, as I have already encountered four outages in the past ten days.I have contacted your customer service five times, and the resolution offered has been inadequate, with the issue being attributed to CityFibre. While I understand that Vodafone uses CityFibre's network, my contract is with Vodafone, and I expect Vodafone to address and resolve these service disruptions promptly.The frequent outages have significantly impacted my daily activities and work, and I am seeking immediate action to rectify this situation. I would appreciate it if you could:Provide a clear explanation of the cause of these repeated outages.Offer a timeline for resolution.Compensate for the inconvenience suffered due to lack of consistent services.I have been paying Vodafone for reliable internet service, and I expect Vodafone to take responsibility for ensuring its provision, regardless of the third-party networks involved.Please treat this matter with urgency and let me know how you intend to resolve these issues.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.Sincerely,19/05 7 hours latter Update: contacted the team as requested not only they gave the same responses as I had before but I wasted another 3 hours explaining everything over again! So it‚Äôs even worse than before20/05 NEW UPDATE - 30 hours and couting with no resolution and no internet. Vodafone are not willing to let me out of the contract withou paying Early Exit Fee but also is not giving me a sulution to my problem.",Danilo Busseni,GB,2025-05-20T11:19:12.000Z

1,"I received an email nearly a week ago out of the blue telling me that I owed Vodafone money for equipment. I.e. an iPhone I purchased when I was a Vodafone broadband/mobile customer which I had been paying for and it turned out that I had accidentally cancelled the DD so I immediately tried to contact Vodafone by email asking them for details so I could either pay off any remaining balance in full or reset the DD. I since emailed them twice but absolutely no response! In the meantime I have received two threatening emails that unless I contacted they would pass it to a collection company. With that comes the problem with my credit reference file but clearly Vodafone don‚Äôt care! So Vodafone why the threatening emails? This could all have been resolved within minutes and the DD reset or the balance paid off but clearly you would rather make my life more difficult instead. Do your homework first about this company before using them as a supplier. 1600. 19.05,2025.  So Vodafone you are sorry for the experiences I have had from your company. So why are you not able to ‚Äúreach out‚Äù to me as you say I can?

1,"Ordered broadband.  Couldn't fit due to rat chewing the fibre in a post. Fair enough so waited for it to be fixed got told 31st, then 3rd then 7th then 13th then 28th of May. Fair enough open reach could just do the work but reality is vodaphone just kept telling me the wrong dates for it to be fixed. I'm an ex telecoms engineer so I know the pole just needed capping at the top and a splice in the post... Hour work easy. Instead they are trying to request permission to change the whole post which means planning permission which takes months. I thought well give it time I get the ¬£6 compo / day. It'll be practically be free when doneHowever, then some smarty pants from vodaphone starts calling in the day, kindly told them I'm working nights, need to sleep call me back later I need sleep. Guy ignores this keeps yapping. I hung up then decided I'll just keep ringing even when I've picked the phone up I'm getting more calls from vodaphone.Now I've cancelled my broadband order and I'm going to cancel both mobile contracts next.Congrats. Maybe next time you'll let a man sleep. Not too sure why it asks for a location for Vodafone in York or Aberdeen when filling this in cause the issue was clearly in India.",Tommy Lea,GB,2025-05-19T12:34:22.000Z
1,"I genuinely regret choosing Vodafone for both my broadband and mobile phone contract. I was sold their premium ""Pro II Broadband"" package on the promise of easy setup and expert support. None of it was delivered.The broadband never linked to my account, despite following every instruction. I tried to call for help ‚Äî only to discover that it‚Äôs not even possible to speak to a human being. I was forced to use a chatbot, which got me nowhere. Repeated requests for a callback were refused or ignored. Eventually, I was promised a call within the hour, and then a manager would follow up within 7 days. It‚Äôs now well past that, no one has ever called back.On top of that, I took out the mobile plan as part of a bundle which included a trade-in discount. I honestly described the phone, sent it in, and later received a vague text saying it was ""not as described"" ‚Äî with no explanation and the discount seemingly withdrawn.Most upsetting of all, I told Vodafone at the point of purchase that I had recently undergone brain surgery, and asked that communication be made slowly, verbally, and followed up in writing. I was assured this would be no problem. Instead, I have been fobbed off by automated systems, and nobody at Vodafone has made the slightest effort to respect the reasonable adjustments I requested, which they are legally required to make under the Equality Act.I‚Äôve sent multiple formal complaints, all ignored. No resolution. No apology. No service.This has been exhausting and completely unacceptable. I‚Äôm now escalating to CISAS (Vodafone‚Äôs dispute resolution scheme), but the time and energy this has cost me is not something I will soon forget.Avoid Vodafone at all costs, and if you do choose them, pray you never need support.PS Don't believe me, go look at any Facebook post and you will see a list of very unhappy customers trying to seek a resolution through other means, because they don't care about service!",Matthew MacDonald,GB,2025-05-19T12:33:41.000Z

1,"Edit*** after spending 4 hours trying to contact Vodafone on both the number provided and the social media chat- as said in Vodafones response to this review. Nothing has been resolved and they just keep advising us to call the same number while still holding the phone. Once again, poor customer service from Zidane and Khushboo who said they didnt know how to help, other than for me to pay ¬£750. STAY AWAY from this company. I have been a loyal vodafone customer for over 20 years. I bought a phone with vodafone that is still in warranty. The sim card reader stopped working. They tried to give me a virtual sim, which didnt work. Then when sending it to them they quoted me ¬£750 to repair for a phone i can buy brand new for ¬£300. I then questioned the person on the phone and he laughed and ended the phone on me. I pay for 4 phones and will never pay a penny to vodafone again. Stay far away from this company, no loyalty to customers whatsoever. Its clear why they have a 1 star review, go to EE or O2 and stay away from this backstabbing company. I am taking business far away from them.",Tamzin,GB,2025-05-19T20:22:10.000Z

I contacted Vodafone who advised the sale/connection was not completed their end and would take a further 3-5 business days to complete - after a whole month since the order date! Spoke with Vodafone (via the tortuous TOBI chat) today,19th May, to ask for activation status after their initial reply below and they advised me to wait until 27th May before checking for progress!? Vodafone account cancelled!Vodafone still haunts me! Cancellation glitch prevented cancellation with fibre provider CityFibre which prevents my new ISP from activating me until 4th June!

1,"Once I arrived in the UK for the first time, they convinced me to sign a 2-year contract with a monthly fee of 12.5 ¬£ for the first 6 months. However, I was naive and didn't notice that it was a marketing trap. Now, my wife and I are paying 63 ¬£ monthly for just 2 lines, and they are not accepting any cancellations or even changing plans with fewer data. My wife contacted them multiple times and explained to them she couldn't find a job and couldn't afford the bill, but they threatened her that if you don't pay the bill, it would be bad for your credit. They are not showing any flexibility. Be careful, don't trust any long-term contract with operators, especially Vodafone.",arash mortezapour,GB,2025-05-18T23:56:27.000Z
5,I was having trouble with coverage on my previous network so I called into the Vodafone shop in Ards shopping centre. I had a chat with the manager and he recommended their Voxi Sim as I am only a Pay as you go customer. He helped me obtain my PAC code so that I could keep my old number and set the whole thing up for me. I am amazed by the improvement in coverage compared to previous provider. I run a small business and attend events where I accept card payments but this only works when I have good mobile data coverage - I was losing sales before I switched to Vodafone.

5,Since being with Vodafone from November 2024 I have had quite some difficulty phoning Vodafone and getting things sorted so I can use it. I did end up losing my sim card back in Jan 2025 and then later ordered which they said would take 3-5 working days to arrive. But didn't. Had debt collectors on me to for a SIM card I don't even use and still have to pay for. Today I tried to activate my SIM card to use for my WiFi and was told from the first colleague it has been inactive since 15th April. Shocking that no one told me. But was past over to a lovely lady called Savera who helped me get rid of my old SIM number and get a new one. The 1hr and 31 mins of that phone was so helpful. She has been the most helpful one since being with Vodafone from end of 2024. She explained everything thoroughly for me and my partner and helped order and new one which hopefully should arrive tomorrow ‚ò∫Ô∏è We need a lot more people like Savera. :) (Give her a raise or praise at least please),Ryder Hunt,GB,2025-05-18T13:37:24.000Z

It could have taken 72 hours with no mobile phone, but it had to be done! It actually took around 2 hours and my phone was receiving texts and calls were clear and no longer cutting connection or going dumb.A previous 'network issue' had been solved but my phone number was 'forgotten' by the machine.

1,"I went 128 days without broadband after moving house, despite Vodafone promising installation by the end of December. I was repeatedly given conflicting information, had to chase updates myself, and was even told my order had been cancelled without my consent.After two months of waiting, I was given a temporary WiFi dongle. The signal was poor due to my location, but I was told I wouldn‚Äôt be charged for it and would be refunded any fees. I‚Äôve now been charged ¬£77 for it, and when I tried to claim this back, Vodafone said they couldn‚Äôt find any record of that promise ‚Äì so I‚Äôm out of pocket on top of everything else.No one seemed to take ownership, and each time I contacted them, I had to start from scratch with a new adviser. I had to take time off work for missed appointments and even went into a store just to try and get answers.The delay was apparently due to Openreach needing to carry out work, but Vodafone didn‚Äôt manage this properly or communicate clearly. I finally got connected in May ‚Äì nearly four and a half months later ‚Äì but only after a long and stressful battle.Would not recommend if you‚Äôre relying on them for a time-sensitive move or expect to be treated fairly.",Hannah,GB,2025-05-17T12:24:08.000Z

1,"I‚Äôve had a number of issues with Vodaphone since joining. Really slow Internet connection being the main issue. In April we lost all internet connection and spoke with someone who managed to fix the issue after 24 hours. Then we lost internet connection on another 3/4 occasions which took over 48 hours to fix and hundreds of conversations later just telling us to turn the power off, reset the box etc etc We asked on so many occasions for them to send an engineer out to fix the issue which they refused to do despite having no internet for days on end. Eventually we managed to get one sent out but that came with its own issues. Cancelling appointments, not turning up etc. when they did eventually come out it turns out everything was installed poorly and no wonder we kept losing internet connection. Fixed the issue and when I spoke to Vodaphone they tried telling me we are entitled to about ¬£9 compensation‚Ä¶ what a joke!!! After arguing to multiple people and getting the same results we have managed to get our April bill payment back (which would be applied  as a credit to use towards next bill) but guess what we haven‚Äôt even had that!!!!!!!

They would easily be able to see the phone number had not been used but carried on charging me over ¬£67 for every ongoing month for a phone number that they could see had NO USAGE & hadn't even been upgraded for donkeys years WITHOUT any notifications, although they said they wrote I never received anything. They kept me on the phone being passed from person to person for over an hour & a quarter. They wouldn't even allow me to settle in full & told me Ill gave to call back in June to pay another final bill as they cant predict what the bill will be, even though it will be the flat rate and not in use!

1,"Vodafone UK has the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Since 14:00 today (and it‚Äôs now 21:45), I have been in contact with about 10 different Vodafone UK customer service representatives, both on the phone and via chat, and none of them has been able to help me.The simple issue is that no one can reach my number by phone ‚Äî no one is able to call me ‚Äî and nobody has been able to resolve or assist with this. When I was finally able to log into my Vodafone UK account (which was also a big hassle), I tried to upgrade my plan, hoping that might fix the issue of not being reachable. But when I attempted to upgrade, the message said: ""This number is not able to upgrade"" and ""Can't upgrade with this number.""None of the representatives could help me. Some of them even hung up on me for no reason, probably because the issue was too challenging to solve.On top of that, all of your services ‚Äî the website, chat, and app ‚Äî have major issues. It‚Äôs never clear if they‚Äôre working properly. For someone to suddenly become unreachable feels like a horror movie.All that was left was to get a PAC code, transfer my number to a different provider, and finally get the hell away from them.Never again, Vodafone UK.Best.",Emilia,CH,2025-05-15T22:06:57.000Z

1,"Appalling Administration / Customer Service All ok until I tried to renew my contract. My engineer appointment was cancelled but I only discovered this a few days before, when I tried to find out why I'd had no confirmation. 3 MONTHS later, 1) I am out of contract, paying more for my broadband than I was quoted for an UPgraded service2) I am locked out of my account - neither my log in, or mobile number are 'recognised', despite a message being sent to this number every month3) I have wasted countless hours and suffered immense frustration at the dreadful AI / customer care teams who quote from a script with no understanding or means to do anything + a few advisors who were very helpful and assured me everything would be resolved but nothing actually happened. 4) A formal complaint has achieved nothing, yet I was asked today, for permission to close it.Update - the reply proves my point. I'd put my order number but I'm asked to contact facebook team to repeat everything I've already said by phone, email, chat and now an external review.

1,"I bought a phone with a case. The case was not available, despite what the salesperson said over the phone. Another salesperson lied that it had ‚Äújust been delivered‚Äù and claimed we couldn‚Äôt cancel that part of the order. Then someone else said they never received it in the first place, only to later promise they would cancel it‚Äîwhich was also a lie. I was strung along repeatedly. Completely unprofessional and disorganized. Horrible experience.Now, while I‚Äôm away from home for an extended period, they suddenly decide to send the case I‚Äôve asked to cancel multiple times. Of course, because I‚Äôm not home, it will be returned. My contract is new, but the second it ends, I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôd rather have no phone at all than be stuck with this company. Avoid at all costs. Of course never got the money back.",Robert Kabat,GB,2025-05-15T16:04:50.000Z

1,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start with how terrible Vodafone‚Äôs service has been ‚Äì both in-store and over the phone. I was pre-approved for two contracts, even though I only needed one. The store staff were completely unhelpful, uninterested, and ignored me throughout the process. I ordered an iPhone 16 Pro and a Microsoft Surface Pro laptop. They gave me the phone in-store and said the laptop would be delivered.On the delivery day, I was at home the entire time. The DPD driver didn‚Äôt even knock ‚Äì instead, they marked it as ‚Äúincorrect pin‚Äù . When I called Vodafone to get it redelivered, they pushed me to DPD. DPD said they can‚Äôt redeliver and that it‚Äôs going back to the warehouse.So who do I believe? DPD says it‚Äôs still in transit. Vodafone says it‚Äôs already out of stock. Then Vodafone says, ‚ÄúSince you passed the credit check, we‚Äôll give you another device.‚Äù I waited for laptop to get restocked. Then later after months I asked for a Samsung Fold phone instead ‚Äî now suddenly I‚Äôm not eligible anymore? Why pre-approve two contracts and promise a replacement if that‚Äôs not true?And here‚Äôs the real problem ‚Äî Vodafone just tells you anything to get you off the line. They give you completely false information. Every agent has a different story. One says a complaint has been raised. Another says no record of any complaint. One says I won‚Äôt be charged. Another says I owe a payment. It‚Äôs all lies just to make you stop calling. No one takes responsibility.To top it off, I paid ¬£100 upfront for the laptop. They said the contract was cancelled and I wouldn‚Äôt be charged. But I was charged for one month and received payment reminder messages. It took TWO MONTHS and constant follow-ups just to get my upfront fee refunded. And that only happened because I kept chasing them ‚Äî not because Vodafone did their job.Vodafone, your customer service is beyond disgraceful. You treat customers with zero respect. This has been the most frustrating experience I‚Äôve ever had with any company. I‚Äôll never use Vodafone again, and I would strongly advise anyone reading this: don‚Äôt fall for their lies. They‚Äôll promise you everything and deliver nothing",B.Prashanthi Reddy,GB,2025-05-15T14:45:36.000Z

1,"I have been a customer with Vodafone for over 20 yrs for my mobile phone and still am , have also been with their home broadband for 7 years , there have been issues but generally ok , the call centres can be problematic due to language barriers , as they are all based abroad in either Egypt or India , they try but often not easy due to accents etc .Today I have terminated my new contract for full fibre broadband due to the atrocious mix up , they told me they would price match any other advertised deal available ( in my case Gigaclear offering 500mbps for 24 a month ) as I have my mobile with them I get a Vodafone together discount of ¬£2 plus the max discount they could offer is ¬£9 ‚Ä¶which brought it down to ¬£33 ‚Ä¶they then said they would credit my account for the remaining amount to bring it down to ¬£24 a month ‚Ä¶however this was all done VERBALLY and when the contract arrived I was being charged ¬£33 which isn‚Äôt what was agreed . ‚Ä¶bearing in mind I spent a whole hour on the phone dealing with this . I was promised a call back which never happened , so have no cancelled which is a shame as I prefer to stay with the same company and avoid the hassle of moving ‚Ä¶but I am now signing up with Gigaclear ‚Ä¶so bye bye Vodafone , you‚Äôve lost a good customer ‚Ä¶and when my mobile phone contract runs out in September I shall go with another company .

My daughter decided on what she wanted and we agreed to purchase a contract. I then spoke about getting an additional number and handset and this was sorted with the same efficiency and courtesy as the first enquiry. After hearing what was offered, I also purchased another contract. My other daughter also enquired about broadband and a new iPad and again, this was handled exactly the same way. We went in for 1 phone upgrade and left with 1 upgrade, 1 additional phone, 1 broadband deal and an iPad. We were in the store for nearly 2hrs but everything went very smoothly with 0 issues. Matty even took time to try and keep my young granddaughter entertained as she was understandably getting bored.

2,"Be aware before going with Vodafone Broadband. They do not have their own installer team. They use CityFibre. See my review on that company!At no stage am did I know that they didn‚Äôt use their own people. If you buy the installation will NOT be a complete installation and explanation of what you have or how to set it up. It‚Äôs how fast can we get out of the property and go for a beer!! I hope the service is better than the installation, but if the installation and help is anything to go by‚Ä¶..I might have made a huge mistake!!I will review the service in 6 months which is a fair trial!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!",Tony Horsley,GB,2025-05-14T20:06:37.000Z

1,Absolutely atrocious service! My wife's parents moved home and their router hasn't worked properly since. I work in I.T. and know it's clearly the router because it's dropping out once you go beyond 5 meters. The hub is 7 years old so due to be replaced. They recently signed up for a new contract and were told to use the existing hub. My sister in law spent two hours on the phone asking them to send a replacement hub and they flat out refused because their remote checks say it's working. Tried to up sell to a different package instead of actually fixing the problem. Personally I would avoid completely,Lee,GB,2025-05-14T19:48:55.000Z
1,"it is unreliable and unstable broadband connection. It has been a year with Vodafone and when I reported the first issue, manager on the shift was arrogant by not even accept to speak to me. They will just pass information through their agents who discuss the issue on your behalf, as if the manager does not want to speak to customers. what a shameful behaviour.

5,"I don't usually leave reviews, but the service I received at Vodafone in Ashton was genuinely exceptional and deserves recognition.From the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and made to feel like a valued customer. The star of the show? Viken ‚Äì hands down the best member of staff I‚Äôve ever encountered in any mobile store. His knowledge, patience, and professionalism were second to none. He took the time to understand exactly what I needed, explained all the options clearly, and never once made me feel rushed or pressured.Viken went above and beyond to make sure I left with the best deal for my needs. He even helped transfer everything over from my old phone and made sure everything was working perfectly before I left. Nothing was too much trouble.In an age where good customer service is becoming rare, Viken is a breath of fresh air. Vodafone Ashton ‚Äì you‚Äôve got a gem on your team.

1,"I‚Äôve had a terrible experience with Vodafone. I called on 29 April to relocate my broadband service to my new flat. The agent told me it would be set up by 6 May, which felt like a long wait, but I accepted it. As the date approached, I was notified that the installation had been rescheduled to 9 May. I took a day off work to accommodate this.On 9 May, the technician arrived but was unable to complete the job due to missing tools, and I was told it would be rescheduled again to 13 May. I reluctantly agreed, as I urgently need the internet.On 13 May, I took another day off and waited the whole day for the technician. I then received a notification saying I had been ""missed"" ‚Äî despite being home all day and available. I tried to call, but there was no contact number provided, and I received no prior communication to confirm the technician‚Äôs arrival.This is extremely frustrating and unprofessional. After all these delays and poor service, I‚Äôve decided to cancel my Vodafone account and will be switching to a more reliable provider.I would not recommend Vodafone to anyone based on my experience.",Joy Remo,GB,2025-05-14T15:54:15.000Z

1,"Rubbish service. Words fail me.1) Website crashed when I chose the 'Add plan' option to try to see my option to buy a SIM-only plan with an 'exclusive discount. Gave up trying and went over to the chat;2) After slogging through the time-wasting chatbot options I eventually got to chatting with a human being. Agent just went into listing what she wanted to sell me instead of listening to my requirements. Gave up on the chat;3) Got a phone call from the same agent to try and salvage the situation. Got a very bad VoIP line from India (agent had very heavy Indian accent). The bad line and heavy accent made it nearly impossible  but eventually I got a SIM-only deal for ¬£8.33+VAT / month for 18 months. It had taken 2 failed attempts and an hour of my time so far;4) Next day got a 'Welcome' email saying the contract was for ¬£20+VAT per month. Called Vodafone to get a correction. Got an agent with a really heavy Eastern European accent who just told me I had 3 options - cancel the contract and restart with a new price, wait until next billing cycle to sort it out, and another irrelevant option. Had to argue really hard that Vodafone had already agreed to the ¬£8.33+VAT and it was their job to confirm the correct price by checking their audit trail - it was not my job to fix their quality control problems;4) Agent mentioned a ¬£14 discount, then it clicked that the original welcome email had bad HTML in it that rendered the '¬£' sign as something out of a Space Invaders game so the info about the discount was just gobbledygook but also buried as an after-thought at the bottom of the message. More to the point they should have stated clearly what I am paying and not the price before discount. Simple. Another 30 mins. wasted;Vodafone are a basket case.- website doesn't work;- webchat is a time-waster with agents badly trained;- atrocious overseas voice connections to call-centre agents;- use of call-centre agents with unacceptable English skills;- failure to check outbound emails for accuracy and legibility;- agents are programmed to provide the responses that Vodafone want to give instead of what the customer needs as though we exist for their benefit;",Stephen Farndon,GB,2025-05-14T14:31:44.000Z

1,I opened a Broadband Account in December 2024 but decided that I didn't want to proceed with it and cancelled with Vodafone within the 14 day cooling off period.  Even though I received the router I never opened the box or used the service.  There is a Vodafone store where I live so I returned the equipment and was told the account was closed.. WRONG.In January I received a missed payment letter.  I called Vodafone and they said it was an error and not to worry they will close the account. I then received a missed payment letter in February.  I went back to the store (when I called the Call centre they could not access the account) and they agreed the account should be closed and again told me it had been sorted out. I then received a credit report which was showing missed payments thus affecting my credit score. When I disputed these so-called missing payments these were showing as cleared but now I have April and May showing as missed.  How can anyone trust Vodafone to provide a decent service when they cannot get a simple matter of closing an account right!,Fenton Bowley,GB,2025-05-14T12:16:01.000Z

1,"Did the mistake to book broadband service with Vodafone. The most incompetent company EVER. I book the service since April to be activated on 13th of May. On 28th of April I received a text message saying that no engineer visit is need and I just have to plug in the equipment on the day. On the 13th while I was at work I received a call from an openreach engineer saying that I had a booking. Obv as I was not inform there was no one in to open him. Ofc the broadband never gone live on the day, with me spending hours in online chat and calls to see if the can resolve the issue. The outcome was that I have to wait another 2 days with NO INTERNET and call again after 2 days to book a new engineer appointment. JUST BECAUSE VODAFONE thought that it will be good idea not to inform me that an engineer will have to visit.",Panayiotis Panteli,US,2025-05-14T11:00:33.000Z

1,"I received a letter through the post saying 900Meg broadband was now available in my area and i can switch now. The price was super attractive and they said they would handle everything, contact my current provider and pay upto ¬£100 to cover the switch cost. So i thought great and signed up. A week later i get a call to say the order is cancelled and spend over an hour on the phone to find out they cant provide fibre in my area. They have already contact my current provider and cancelled my current subscription for me and now i will have no internet for  a period of time. I work from home full time and cant work without internet. This is terrible service, not only will i have no internet for a week+ but i have also wasted over an hour on the phone to these clowns.Avoid at all cost, they are cheap for a reason, They are terrible!",Daniel Pickett,GB,2025-05-14T10:22:35.000Z

1,Bought a phone on Saturday was told it would switch from O2 on Tuesday. got a mail from Vodafone at 1300 sawing switch had happened but phone dead.  Went back to Marlborough store at 1700. After an hour of messing about store manager assured me it would be sorted at midnight. Gave me a ¬£10 sim so I would not be without a phone as I had been asked to erase old one. ¬£10 sim did not work! As of 0800 still no working phone.  Empty promises and shocking customer serviceEdited. Been asked by Vodafone to call them. How stupid! I DO NT HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!,Simon Tillling,GB,2025-05-14T09:50:37.000Z
1,Vodafone has serious network problems in multiple locations.  Experiencing mobile data speeds on my iPhone 14 of 0.88 Mbps download and 0.30 Mbps upload - EE speeds where I am are 136 Mbps download on the same device and Vodafone are being cheeky saying it‚Äôs my phone that‚Äôs broken and not their terrible network. Had to cancel the wife‚Äôs sim as a second line as she had the same problem (within 14 days cooling off period). Problem at multiple locations over a wide area.  Vodafone seem to have had no 4G Coverage (and they won‚Äôt deploy it and same for 5G in some areas) and what‚Äôs been happening is the phones have been using 3G which is in the process of being turned off.  If it‚Äôs not a very busy area there‚Äôs no 5G so you receive the lowest possible speeds less than 1 Mbps (less than 128 kilobyte download speeds)Phone swaps between 1 bar and network unavailable at times where as I have a good signal on the second sim with EE (business use only).  No matter how much I complain to Vodafone they don‚Äôt want to help and they repeatedly ask me to do various things to reset network settings even though it‚Äôs their awful network. EDIT; they don‚Äôt care. Broadband is the wrong team.  I‚Äôve already asked for it to be raised as a complaint but they‚Äôve not done so please sort this out.  It‚Äôs horrendous the problems I‚Äôm facing its data speed it‚Äôs noise on the line and problems sending text messages because of the very weak signal where I live.  There‚Äôs also problems at multiple addresses /locations even far from home.,Ben,GB,2025-05-14T09:04:39.000Z

1,"Internet connection is actually diabolical with being bellow guaranteed minimum speeds 40 odd days now since signing up to them, barely ever works on my games consoles and the price is way to high for the service actually getting as I have constant issues with Internet being barely 1Mbps. Lets get on about there customer service.. its actually a joke being run round and round in circles with the same test and the same questions over and over blaming everything but them selves. Was even told that I was only going to get 100mbps with the cable being used from the box in the wall and told me the 'speed i was getting' was 102mbps when actually I was getting 750mpbs so was straight out lied to. I've had better Internet on dial up! Stay away from vodafones apparent full fiber. Its full crap!!! I will be changing with immediate effect as they have now breached contract with 36 registered speed tests being under minimum guaranteed and nothing being done about it after constantly complaints and requesting an engineer visit. Would not even recommend you if you were the last ISP on earth!!",Stuart Nunn,GB,2025-05-13T20:51:12.000Z
1,"Initially requested an upgrade to full fibre 3 months ago, was given an installation date and then nothing happened. When I contacted them they said their operative had cancelled it (no warning given). SO went thru the process again, was eventually fitted (after several weeks, road and garden being dug up by openreach and finally fibre installed by another sub-contractor).Never received a new 'powerhub' as promised. Now their is good wifi speed but only within a few feet of the old router. Contacted them to explain and request a replacement and after over an hour of pointless checks, tests and hanging around waiting for their operative to reply have been fobbed off with the 'everything is fine, there is no problem' routine. Abysmal customer service. Now I have the joy of trying to get through to them on the phone to cancel the contract.Vodafone - simply not worth the hassle!",Krishna,GB,2025-05-13T20:33:11.000Z

1,"We have used Vodafone home broadband since October 2024 and have always had a cut-off issue a couple of times per day. I lost track of how many times I called customer service about this. The support guys were great. Always did their best to help, but nothing has changed. 1 day good, the day after very poor connection. I begged them to change the device, maybe it is faulty, or send an engineer to check, but they said the line seems okay, and they cannot do that. My husband and I work from home and today we could not complete our tasks and missed our SLAs! onlye because of the bad internet connection. Congratulations, Vodafone, and thank you for not helping me with this situation. This is your fault, your connection issue, and you asked me to pay the early cancellation fee of around ¬£300 instead of having a professional conversation from custoemr success. I am just told a formal complaint form has been raised and you will reach me out. I will not be your customer from the 15th, and because you see it on your system, you probably will reach out on the 16th and say "" there is nothing you can do because I cancelled my contract"" I know this scenario. Huuuugeee disappointment. You always had bad network connections check how many times i reached you out. You never manage to fix it permanately and in the end you forced me to pay early termination fee. I terminated my contract with you today due to poor connections, which is your responsibility, and I received an email that you said that an estimated ¬£300 something will be added to my final bill. Speechless! I will also change my mobile contract, but unfortunately, I need to wait until the end because otherwise, you will charge me for another ¬£300. Never say never, but NEVER get your broadband ( City fibre) I mentally felt down, spent hours on the phone, missed my SLAs and now I need to work more to close the gap instead of spending time with my child. Thank you for that! Well done. Just pay a bit more and go with more pro home broadband brands. They do not care who you are or how struggle you are.",Ozge Chassang,GB,2025-05-13T17:44:11.000Z

1,"For broadband- we booked our move to take Vodafone with us to our new property on 11th March (moving date of 31st March). They came out to us on the 2nd April to fit the connection but was unable to do so due to external works needing to be completed. They said someone would be back out within 2-5 working days. After weeks of chasing and a lot of stress (whilst being heavily pregnant) they eventually came back out to do the external work on 7th May (over a month later). The connection still didn‚Äôt go live so we were told an engineer would come out and it would be live by midnight on 9th May. We are now on the 13th May and were promised a technician out today between 8am- 1pm. They haven‚Äôt turned up. For context, they are aware I‚Äôm over 37 weeks pregnant and don‚Äôt have any access to internet or signal meaning I am unable to contact anyone in an emergency. We are paying ¬£25 a month for a 5G dongle to try and get some form of internet through Vodafone which also doesn‚Äôt work and they‚Äôve not once offered to pay to compensate this. Due to working from home, I have had to fund and organise alternative travel and working arrangements for the last month and a half. Today they are still telling us they don‚Äôt know when the technician will be out and that it could be tomorrow or longer. I have been promised call backs from managers and they haven‚Äôt called. I have had to call to chase every few days. Do not trust if they tell you someone will call you or be out to your property as it doesn‚Äôt go ahead. The stress of this is causing me to be seriously unwell. They are a shocking company with no organisation or ability to talk successfully between teams. Do not trust what they say as we have been told so many lies since the start of April. As soon as we receive the compensation owed we will be changing provider. We‚Äôve only been with them since the start of the year and haven‚Äôt had internet for half the time. Will be going back to Sky.",Gabriella Reynolds,GB,2025-05-13T14:16:18.000Z

1,"We have recently changed to Vodaphone for our broadband and the service has been absolutely shocking. The hub was installed 6 days ago and we still have no internet or phone. Staff on the helplines seem to be genuinely trying to help but just keep telling us to restart the router and then say we need to wait another 72 or 48 hours. Nobody can tell us what we are waiting for. One person told us we need a new hub but he is unable to order one, we have to wait another few days first. We have spent hours in the phone to them with no success. They can‚Äôt do anything to help, they can‚Äôt provide a service but they can of course send a bill! So disappointing.",Ali J,GB,2025-05-13T08:06:53.000Z
2,"Vodafone failed to provide a complete service. I have had to open several support requests for the same issue, which remains unsolved to date.

1,I have been struggling for a couple of weeks with VF as my mobile contract is ending. Its appears a VF contract coming to an end is not as clear as it seems.  Chat is terminated abruptly after hours trying to get a clear answer from them. Today my VF mobile number was cancelled ( not on my instructions ) and so was the PAC to transfer to a new provider even tho it was good until the 28 May and I used it on Friday 9 May. No i have no mobile with VF or Lebara. VF claim i asked for it to be cancelled ( i didnt ) and cant issue a new PAC as they have closed the mobile account. Hours later on chat as they have killed my mobile contract and two abrupt dropping of chat I am getting no where other than go into the Ombudsman.

I looked at other providers and found one company with a really good deal offering the latest phone and watch, significant data and absolutely no price increases during the term of the contract. I phone Vodafone to see if they would match this deal but despite my loyalty over those years, they were not prepared to offer anything like that. No compromise, just sorry no can do, so regretfully I have taken my business elsewhere. Vodafone have been slow when it came to 5G so that helped my decision.

1,"Absolutely baffled by Vodafone's upgrade policy. I've been a paying customer, never missed a bill, and now that I‚Äôm eligible for an upgrade, they‚Äôve declined it after a fresh credit check? Excuse me? What other network does that? I was previously with O2, and if you paid off your device, you could upgrade freely‚Äîno ridiculous hoops to jump through and certainly no invasive credit checks just to give them more money.Vodafone, you might want to rethink your priorities. Alienating loyal, creditworthy customers over something as petty and nonsensical as a credit check for an upgrade is how you lose people. It's not 2009 anymore‚Äîusers have options, and I, for one, will be exploring every single one of them. You‚Äôve officially made it to the list of ‚Äúnetworks to avoid at all costs.‚ÄùUnbelievable.",Yusuf Morris,GB,2025-05-11T10:40:04.000Z

They kept sending me a text to put in my card details I was on hold for ages and they kept saying payment had not gone through. They would not let me hang up and I was on hold for ages. Very arrogant customer adviser with a lack of empathy. I lost my temper and I had to hang up. Disgusting service.

1,"I was supposed to be connected on 17 April. They told me a couple of days before the 17th that city fiber engineers faced a challenge. They call me and explain that they will get the next update around the 30th. I call them on the 30th and they have no update! They told me that I will be connected by 8 May. I wait again and call them a couple of days before the 8th. It turns out that city fiber wants me to get a consent from my neighbor to dig in their garden. I find this request ridiculous and also very unspecific (how much of their garden do they need to dig?). I ask specific questions and wait again for a couple of days. Then they now tell me that an engineer can attend and explain what needs to be done but the earliest they can do is the 29th of May.Before choosing Vodafone, one thing I should have realized is that they rely on City Fiber for connecting my home to the network. They may promise a date but that is if only everything goes well. This is different from a company that actually owns a fiber network.Even within the providers depending on City Fiber‚Äôs network, I think I would choose a different one because I get the sense that Vodafone does not take any proactive steps to connect me as soon as possible. They have not called me once since the challenge became obvious. If I hadn‚Äôt called them and asked what is going on, I wouldn‚Äôt have received any updates. They seem to have no way to prioritize me even though I am waiting to be connected for three weeks.EDIT: the copy and paste reply to this review accurately summarizes my experience. They are extremely friendly but do not listen to customers.",RT,GB,2025-05-10T21:52:00.000Z

1,"When I set up my broadband and phone, the site kept crashing on me. So I ended up joining over the phone.  I've never been able to login in. I can't reset the password either, as the reset code message never gets sent to my phone. I've never been sent a bill, I've been getting charged every month. But I don't actually know what for. Some months its a bit more or a bit less, but I have no idea why. As I've never been able to see a bill.I got an email this week saying my contract was up. But as I've never been able to log in, I couldn't see the offers. I got so fed up that I couldn't log in so I changed providers. But now they want to charge me a ¬£80 early leaving fee. But I've never seen my contract, so I don't actually know what day it ends on. I think I'm just going to have to take the ¬£80 hit for my sanity. We are just going around and around in circles with customers services. (They always try to be helpful, but we never get anywhere. The AI chatbot that they keep pushing you to on the website is useless though).It just really annoys me, why tell me the contract is ending and then charge me a early leaving fee. ¬£80 is quite a lot money for me. I really feel like there has been an IT issue with my account since I joined that seems to be unfixable.  Edit - The reply below is exactly my point. I get the same script over and over again. Going around and around in circles until I feel like banging my head off a wall. That's why I'm cutting my losses and leaving. Even though I think its grossly unfair that I'm getting charged a leaving fee, when Vodafone told me my contract was finished. I'm losing money now because Vodafone can't seem to fix my account details on your own system. You don't seem to have someone who can actually fix the problem. I think the details were entered incorrectly when I joined, and I don't know what the operator has entered as my details. That's why I can't get anywhere. And why does it have to be done via Facebook or X. Why can't you give people an email address for example.",Daniel G,GB,2025-05-10T20:01:58.000Z

1,I brought a Samsung zfold 6 from Vodafone 7 months ago. The middle screen has failed at the seam with absolutely no damage to the phone. I spoke to the customer service team and they told me to go in store to get it looked at and fixed. So I drove the 30 minutes to my nearest Vodafone store in scunthorpe who told me they don't deal with it in store and to call Vodafone directly!! I'm now left without a working phone and no bloody idea what to do! Last time I sent my phone away I was told the warranty was voided because of a chip on my screen which I had to prove there wasn't and so this time I'm terrified they will do the same thing. Terrible service.,Courtney,GB,2025-05-10T13:46:38.000Z

1,Abysmal treatment to new customer. Should have been connected 11th April to Vodafone broadband having switched from Sky. What a mistake I've made....Now10th May a month later and still not connected. Paying subscription services I can't access. Never mind the working from home saga. Recieced 21 upselling emails prior to contract start date 11th April. Oddly enough not received anything from them from that date. Wonder why. Only contact was from raising a complaint that to a waste of time and had to ask for an apology. Been told nothing. The customer has to contact them to find out anything in my experience. All that achieves by end of call is the date being moved out another week.At a loss as to what to do. Can't go to a different provider until after my broadband is activated with Vodafone.Shame on you Vodafone.,William,GB,2025-05-10T12:41:30.000Z

1,"Avoid Vodafone Broadband ‚Äì Worst Service ExperienceI signed up for Vodafone broadband expecting a smooth switch using their ""One Touch"" transfer service, which promised a hassle-free, same-day transition. Unfortunately, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. On activation day, I was left with no internet at all.I spent the entire day‚Äî10am to 6pm‚Äîon the phone with Vodafone support, constantly restarting and resetting the modem, with no success. They refused to let me file a formal complaint and left me without service, despite everything working perfectly with my previous provider.I initially chose Vodafone thinking it would be convenient to have broadband and mobile under one bill. Big mistake. I run a home business and rely on internet access for security cameras and daily operations. Vodafone has not only failed to deliver but wasted hours of my time with repetitive, unhelpful steps and no resolution.I'm now cancelling the service after giving them more than enough time to fix the issue. My advice: avoid Vodafone broadband at all costs.",imran nawaz,MA,2025-05-09T18:54:32.000Z

1,"Goodbye Vodafone, a company I've been loyal to for 15 years. I won‚Äôt be back.I never write online reviews. Truly. But after the experience I‚Äôve just had with Vodafone, I felt compelled to make an exception.Let‚Äôs start from the beginning. My phone was stolen in London ‚Äî an unfortunately common occurrence.As part of the usual security protocol, I cancelled all cards that were active on Apple Pay. I went into a Vodafone store the very next day, reported it stolen, and was issued a new SIM card. So far, so good.Then I headed to Apple to sort out a new device. Problem solved? You'd think so, hey.Not a matter of a week later, I began noticing App Store charges coming through on my Vodafone bill ‚Äî not my Apple account. Confused? So was I. How on earth were App Store payments appearing on my Vodafone bill, especially after I had cancelled the linked cards and replaced the SIM?Turns out Vodafone had, without my consent or knowledge, authorised a remote payment sync between my Apple account and Vodafone billing. Something I never agreed to ‚Äî and something that, according to some Vodafone reps, should have been deactivated the moment I reported the phone stolen.I spent a total of six hours on the phone with Vodafone. If I ever hear their hold music again, I might lose my mind. I spoke to countless customer service reps, each with conflicting explanations. Some admitted that the charges should never have gone through. Others tried to shift the blame onto me. All this, despite the fact the charges appeared after I had reported the phone stolen and the SIM replaced.I was told I owed ¬£300. Absolutely not. I refused to pay for a mistake that was clearly theirs. I‚Äôve been a customer for 15 years ‚Äî paying a premium for an overpriced and frankly sub-par service ‚Äî and now I‚Äôm down ¬£2,000 on a new phone and being asked to cover Vodafone‚Äôs screw-up?Eventually, after what felt like hostage negotiations (first they‚Äôd cover 20%, then 50%, then 75%), they finally agreed to remove 100% of the charges. Sounds generous? It wasn‚Äôt. It was damage control ‚Äî for their own mistake. And it took an enormous amount of pressure on my end to get them to do the right thing.This was back in October. So why am I writing this review now?Because it got worse.After clearing the charges, I asked Vodafone to move my account to Pay As You Go, as I‚Äôd recently relocated to the U.S. for 18 months. All seemed fine. Then, during a routine credit check, I discovered a late payment flag from Vodafone had hit my credit score.Baffled, I logged into my account ‚Äî nothing there. I'm on PAYG, so no bills, no charges, no notifications. I call Vodafone again. Guess what? That mysterious late charge? It was from the original bill before they agreed to remove the Apple charges.So despite agreeing to waive the fees ‚Äî again, their error ‚Äî they reported me as having defaulted on a payment. That one flag has now trashed my credit score. For no reason.So here we are. Months of stress, hours of phone calls, gaslighting customer service reps, and a financial headache that‚Äôs still causing ripples.Vodafone: you failed on every front. You mishandled a stolen phone report, tried to make me pay for unauthorised charges, strung me along with inconsistent support, and ultimately damaged my credit over your own mistake.What happened to customer service? What happened to accountability?I‚Äôm done. 15 years of loyalty ‚Äî flushed.Goodbye Vodafone. I won‚Äôt be back.",Sherbert,GB,2025-05-09T17:09:47.000Z

1,Do not ever go with Vodafone broadband.  Their staff told me the hub isn‚Äôt good enough for a house.  I put in a complaint lady called says we will give you a booster.  Half an hour later call saying you need to upgrade to get a booster.  This is after multiple issues with the service.  Would give zero stars if I could.,Mr Stephen Noakes,GB,2025-05-09T17:01:19.000Z

1,"I have used a mobile SIM in my mobile router for some time to provide a basic home broadband solution.It's a shame I've had to leave Vodafone as, when it works, they provide faster indoor speeds than their competitors - however, this has, for some time, been at the expense of appalling reliability- speed frequently drops to <3mbps & often fails completely. It seems that any issue reports dissappear down a black hole as they simply don't care.",Carl Lubbock,GB,2025-05-09T16:04:58.000Z

No matter if your contract includes 50GB or 500GB of data per month, the moment you run out of data, they charge ¬£15 for just 2 extra GB‚Äîa blatant cash grab.

1,"I was moving house so had a mobile vodaphone wi-fi dongle for the last couple of months as I didn't want to renew the contract I had. When I moved, I phoned to pay my final bill and to give them the required 30 days notice. When I paid my bill, the advisor told me I would have nothing else to pay. I then received a final bill request for ¬£51 which of course, I phoned up to complain about as I had been told I had nothing left to pay. Eventually I managed to get through to an actual person instead of their useless virtual assistant and after a lot of wasted time he agreed to listen to the pohone call but said it would take seven days . He arranged to phone me on the 1st May but didn't. On the 3rd May I got a final bill for ¬£5 which I reluctantly paid. On the 8th May at 11.18 I got another final bill for ¬£35.11 and then at 11.19 I got a third final bill for ¬£14.36 and then got a phone call from the advisor who was supposed to phone me on the 1st May. This company is an absolute disgrace and they make it very hard for you to find out exactly how to complain. You can search their website till you are blue in the face and you won't find a simple email address to complain to. They are not a company I would ever want to deal with again.

1,"I recently switched from VOXI to Vodafone and had an extremely frustrating experience due to Vodafone‚Äôs incompetent customer support. The first agent assured me that I could keep my old number by simply filling out a number transfer form. Since I was using an eSIM, I specifically asked how to fill in the serial number section, and the agent told me to just enter all zeros.A week later, my number still hadn‚Äôt transferred. When I contacted support again, a different agent informed me that I needed a physical SIM card first‚Äîcompletely contradicting the first agent‚Äôs instructions. By this point, I was fed up and requested to cancel the Vodafone service and revert to VOXI. Shockingly, the agent said I would still be charged for the days I ""used"" Vodafone, even though this entire mess was caused by their own employee‚Äôs misinformation.This level of unprofessionalism is unacceptable.

Unfortunately, despite multiple attempts to get them to put me on a big value bundle (paying for it, being told it has worked), it never seems to work and i get phone credit instead if a bundle, which runs out very quickly.

1,"I recently switched to Vodafone‚Äôs FTTP broadband expecting a more reliable and faster service than my old Sky copper connection. Unfortunately, the opposite has been true.The WiFi range throughout the house has been shockingly poor. I contacted Vodafone support and, instead of resolving the issue, they suggested I pay extra for their SuperWifi plan ‚Äî essentially upselling a fix for a problem that shouldn't exist in the first place.What‚Äôs most frustrating is the customer service. I was repeatedly asked to carry out the same technical tests on the router, even after explaining multiple times that the issue was with coverage, not the line. It‚Äôs baffling that in 2025, a broadband provider can't offer a router that covers a standard household without additional costs.It feels like Vodafone deliberately supplies a subpar router just to push customers into paying more each month. This isn‚Äôt just bad service ‚Äî it‚Äôs bad practice.I regret switching and would caution others to think twice before moving to Vodafone for broadband.Update:I got in touch with Vodafone again through the Facebook link provided and was told to call them just to have the same script narrated to me about how I need boosters for WiFi to work effectively and this time CS advisor was arguing that I cannot compare two providers because the router is not faulty and different routers have different WiFi ranges (when I mentioned Sky's copper broadband giving me better WiFi coverage). I also reviewed all the 'upgrade offers' Vodafone has under my account and again they are actively promoting Superwifi plan so ultimately you pay ¬£4-5 a month extra for boosters which cost less than ¬£10 for Vodafone to continue rent out equipment to make up for their router providing suboptimal coverage. During the phone call I asked to leave Vodafone given I am still within the cooling off period.",KM,GB,2025-05-08T14:30:52.000Z

1,"I spent over two hours on webchat with customer service after noticing that the broadband deal I signed up for today had already dropped in price by ¬£1 per month. Since I‚Äôm still within the cooling-off period, I reasonably asked if the price could simply be adjusted.Instead, I was told the only option was to cancel the entire contract, return the equipment (installed just hours ago), and then place a new order. I haven‚Äôt even moved into the property yet, so logistically it‚Äôs doable‚Äîbut the policy is unnecessarily rigid and completely inflexible for something so minor.To make things worse, after waiting to be connected to a manager, the chat disappeared with no follow-up. When I asked about how to make a formal complaint, I was told there is no complaints email, making the process deliberately difficult and frustrating.This kind of experience does not inspire confidence. A bit of common sense and flexibility would go a long way.***I don't have social media and don't think I need to create accounts there to file complaints. The complaint process must not be unnecessarily complicated. I expected that someone would have reached out to me given the chat disconnected due to a system glitch, as per the text you've sent.

I cancelled in Feb and they continued to bill me into May. Trying to get a conclusion to this bureaucratic farce proved pointless. I am now going to trading standards and the local press because this shambolic excuse for a company can't even deal with THEIR own problem. Never in my life have I encountered such a useless company. Avoid like the plague if you value your precious time and mental health! BTW....I am still waiting for them to call me back, but I won't hold my breath Update: 8/7/25 They still expect me to chase them on their fb page.....nope! You lot said you would phone me so that's what I expect you to do. I spent 2 hours on the phone for nothing yesterday.  I am DONE chasing you for your mistakes.

My order was confirmed, agreement signed, logins all sorted and confirmations sent from Vodaphone.I ring them on the day the new phone was suppose to be delivered, I spend 45 mins on the phone for them to tell me that the warehouse team did not receive the order and it is a technical glitch, the only option was to cancel the order and reorder later on stating that I ""might"" get the same deal. Completely unfair when they said it was all their fault. I am also not wasting more of my time for their incompetence and their error by telling me to reorder or go into a store. The issue could be resolved but the easiest option was to start again.I am not going to have a go at the colleague on the phone as it is not his fault, but this has completly put me off joining, I will not join as a new customer. The fact that they did not care when I said I would not be reordering kind of confirmed my thinking.Watch now give a generic message about how I can reach out and contact them, thank you for wasting my time and my wife's time who waited all day and took time off work. I was even thinking about changing my broadband, but not anymore.",Josh Walker,GB,2025-05-07T20:25:00.000Z

1,"Due to the terminal illness of my brother in the USA, I was called away suddenly, not knowing when I would return. I've been a client with Vodafone for over ten years. As I was departing the UK, I went online and cancelled my Vodafone via their cancellation link. Within minutes I received confirmation of this, but once stateside some days later received a bill for my monthly service. I am not on a contract and was fully paid up with some days left when I cancelled. On April 7th, having been busy with family illness, I received a bill from Vodafone for my continuing service which I had cancelled weeks earlier and not used since. I went online to Vodafone chat. This began with several minutes of the agent asking if I had any special needs or if there was anything they needed to be made aware of about my circumstance. I made it clear that I left the UK because my brother was terminally ill, with the intent (and notification of) my phone cancellation. I was told that since I didn't apply my STAC number to another phone provider I would be billed until I cancelled (apparently cancellation isn't really cancellation after all!). So on April 7th I cancelled for the second time. Despite my family emergency and traumatic situation, I received no sympathy or support from Vodafone. I might as well have chatted with a bot. Vodafone 'customer care' is cynical and appalling. Next I get a message some days later saying I owed them ¬£17.81 for an overdue balance. For a phone which had not been used and for which the contract had been cancelled a month prior! Busy with other matters (life and death!) I did not immediately attend to this demand for a service I was no longer receiving. Today I received a fresh demand. I now owe ¬£39.98 for an inactive account I have cancelled twice! As it happens my monthly pay as you go was ¬£9 each month; I never went over and I always paid on time. Such blatant profiteering from grief is despicable. When I went online to see what these charges are ... as they are clearly so inflated ... my online account has been deactivated and is inaccessible. So I could just keep paying and paying, for a service I am not receiving at a rate that is re-inflating every few weeks. What a disgusting, corrupt organisation. This is how they pay customer loyalty. And this is how they support their clients. UPDATE: Whilst I appreciate the Vodafone Social Media Team getting in touch, this is a hollow attempt at resolving the problem after I had shown a light on it. I just attempted to contact Vodafone via the link on X provided ... waited an hour for a reply! I was a client in good standing, cancelled my phone service in the way Vodafone set forth, and despite all my efforts, in the hopes of putting things right, I was forced to spent over a half hour on Chat with the 'Vodafone Team' who displayed neither empathy nor genuine interest in understanding my situation or assisting me. The default response from Vodafone seems to be 'just keep charging the client, over and over again without listening.' I now have an email for an amount that has not been explained to me ... and a threat that it will all be turned over to a debt collection agency. A debit sheet where their human concern should be. Now I have filed a formal complaint with Vodafone. Let's see what happens.",Jesse,US,2025-05-22T19:12:09.000Z

1,"Terrible customer serviceI ordered the broadband service on 7th April 2025 to replace my BT home broadband (SoGEA) and phone service. Gave them my address and telephone number to keep.I have a business as well and have a dedicated BT business line that is already on FTTP so understand that an engineer would need to visit to install the fibre service and disconnect the old cable connection.I recieved an email from BT telling me as I was out of contract i would not pay anything and my home broadband and phone would stop when i move to vodafone.Yesterday (6th May) my home broadband stopped working, no engineer and then my business broadband stopped working. I was told by vodafone that the connection can take upto 24 hours to activate.So today, still no vodafone at home and no BT business broadband at the office. I decide to take the vodafone router to the business and low and behold it works. So openreach have decided to take over a business FTTP connection and disconnect a SoGEA one at the same time.On the phone to vodafone for over an hour with the egyptian staff member (Abdul) telling me it is working at the address listed with the telephone number. I ask to make a complaint to wait another 30 mins be to asked what resolution i would like (BT OR to install FTTP at the house and reconnect BT business at the office!?!?!) After the call ending and speaking to someone else still nothing after OVER 3 HOURS apart from a manager may call within 24-48 hours.This has serverly impacted my business and I will be looking to leave vodsfone at the earliest opportunity.I will be sending a complaint in writing to your CEO (Max Taylor) as well as Ofcom.**** update****After spending hours on the phone with poorly trained staff (asking for a serial number of the router and a video call to show the router is not working in its intended location) i havr given up. Vodafone will lose my business, i am trying to get BT business to send an engineer to take over the line again. Vodafone could have sorted this by sending an Openreach engineer to install an fttp connection at the correct location.",Dom,GB,2025-05-08T12:48:59.000Z

1,"I called Vodafone UK to cancel my phone service after using their service for over 2 years. Great connection throughout the time and everything great. However, since I am moving aboard, I called them in Jan 2025 and confirmed with the person on the phone that everything has been cancelled and there's nothing else that I have to do. They asked me to keep my direct debit opened just in case there's any final fee. I then noticed that they continue charging me for Feb and Mar hence I stopped my direct debit. They then started emailing me threatening me that if I do not pay my overdue payment, contract termination fees will be applied, a default being registered with the credit reference agencies, which may make it difficult for me to get loans, credit cards and other phone contracts in the future. I no longer live in the UK but contacted them back to see whats the issue since this shouldn't have happened and hoping for a refund. They then deny anything I told them about the call in Jan 2025 and said I cannot cancel my service until I pay my monthly bill plus extra 5 pound for late payment. I was shocked but still wanting to settle this just in case I need to return to the UK again. This staff on the online chat named Arun took half an hour to verify my identity, replying every 2 mins. Then doing it all again after I pay the fee and transferring me to the cancellation team. At this point I have lost 3 months bills pus extra 5 pound for no reason and now they said that they have cancelled it again and there's nothing that I have do...",William Cheung,GB,2025-05-07T14:49:49.000Z

1,"Vodafone are in a mess. After being a cusotmer for a few years and having three plans with them, I tried to upgrade and order a new phone. I signed all the documents, all the informaiton asked of me was provided. Despite their App crashing and having to call back, which I did, I jumped through every hoop they asked me to. I chased the order through only to find they hadn't processed it. They then quoted me totally different numbers and finally cancelled the phone order but left me with an updated SIM order which, without the phone is a pretty pointless thing to do. I've spend over 1.5 hours on the phone to them today and It's so difficult to get anyone to read the notes. They can't find transcripts from their own app and have no knowledge of the contracts I've signed, even though I offered them copies of their own documents. I'm utterly shocked that a business with such a strong following, is retaining customers if this is how they treat them.",Tim,GB,2025-05-07T12:49:24.000Z

1,"If I could give 0, I literally would. Left me and my partner without a broadband 15 extra days after moving to a new home (when we both WORK FROM HOME!!!!!) due to a fault on their behalf, which resulted in us having to buy extra data to make sure we can work still. And yet no compensation for the distress caused. I have called multiple times, and they have said because there is no automatic compensation applied, they can‚Äôt do anything. I have requested to speak to a manager multiple times, they always have to arrange a call back and surprise, surprise, they only call when I work in the office. Absolutely shocking to be honest. They have no email address so you can‚Äôt even email anyone. You can only write a letter because calling at this point is so pointless. I will be writing a letter, if nothing changes Ombudsman it is. Promising a service and then leaving us for an extra two weeks with no compensation for the mess caused, and then point blank refusing to compensate for the distress caused by is absurd. Definitely a breach of CRA 2015, and I won‚Äôt rest until I am satisfied with an outcome. UPDATE IN RESPONSE TO VODAFONES COMMENT: I have called multiple times with no resolution, I have spoke to your Facebook team that redirected me to call anyway lol, and I have spoken on the chat bot thing. NO ONE is coming to a solution for us.",MT,GB,2025-05-07T09:34:28.000Z

1,"I am surprised to see how many of you have given this company top marks. How many of you have checked your down load upload speeds? Well I have and found the following, I singed up for a 900MB connection and got the following between 200 and 390 MB depending on the time of day. I have complained numerus times, they have tested from their end and tell me would you believe that I am always getting  455 MB. Apparently it is Legal to advertise a connection then only give you half of what your paying for according to Vodaphone.  If your happy to pay for a certain speed and only get half of what your paying at best that is fine but not for me. I would therefore suggest you check your speed by downloading Ookla  free speed test its easy to use and will give you a very accurate result.",Alan Bedford,GB,2025-05-06T14:15:41.000Z
1,"Honestly, one of the most backwards companies I have ever dealt with. First, I‚Äôm told my contract has ended and no further payments will be taken. Then, a few days later, they take money from my account anyway.Naturally, I call to ask why, only to be told about a supposed 30-day closure policy. I understand terms and conditions, but when I‚Äôm explicitly informed that my contract has ended and no further payments will be charged, then money is taken anyway‚Äîit‚Äôs an absolute joke.The punchline? They want yet another payment just to close my account! Ridiculous. I‚Äôve cancelled my direct debit, so good luck getting another penny from me.

1,"Vodafone broadband. I genuinely believe that the call centre staff do not look at your account when you telephone them. I needed to change my banking details as my old bank was closing down. I telephoned the call centre three times at the beginning of April and was assured that there was no issue with my account. I even provided a different account to take payment from. With no notice Vodafhone cut off my internet boardband just before five on Friday 2 May, when I telephoned I was told different things by every different call handler I spoke to. I feel really let down. It took three days for my broadband connection to be restored, eventhough it was their mistake.

1,"Note to Vodafone Social Media Team in response to my previous review of your organisation.I am not on Facebook nor X, therefore the onus is on YOU to resolve this matter. I spent over 2 3/4 hours on your live chat facility and on the telephone to your organisation, collectively, yesterday trying to sort out this matter and reach a satisfactory conclusion but instead I get advised to send an email to a third-party affiliate (which I've done) as Vodafone have decided to take no ownership or responsibility for a technical glitch on their website when I tried to purchase Broadband that has prevented me from receiving the promotional e-giftcard voucher.I've also been in contact with Giftcloud and Broadband comparison websites with a view to finally ascertaining a resolution, but still I am getting nowhere.I am 86 years old and never thought I'd still be fighting the fight at my age to get justice on a matter that is not my fault.I just want to enjoy the rest of my life in peace and without unnecessary barriers being put in my way.",William Stappard,GB,2025-05-06T11:37:26.000Z

5,"We had been experiencing issues with our contracts at Vodafone, and first attempted to resolve it through their online customer support.After an appalling attitude from one customer service agent who made an inappropriate comment, we decided to head into a store.We were greeted by Lorna, a personable, knowledgeable and helpful individual who was enthusiastic to resolve our existing  problems. After hearing the details of our previous experience with online customer support, they swiftly assisted in filing a complaint, and the issue was later concluded. Lorna furthermore demonstrated excellent levels of professionalism, clearly outlining how we could make changes to our contracts where it was lacklustre explained online. After this visit, we had further issues with a separate Vodafone contract, and went in-store on Monday 5th May 2025 after 3 back-and-forth calls with the online customer support team last week to no avail.Despite it being late in the day, and on a bank holiday, we were warmly greeted by Lorna who once again saved the day. Lorna immediately remedied the issue, pointing out an error that was present with the details of the contract. Both of these experiences in-store have been wonderful, with clear communication, sound knowledge of Vodafone policies, friendly and professional demeanour, and a genuine resolution to the issues we were facing. A true 5*, and 10/10 customer experience from Lorna. Thank you!",S,GB,2025-05-06T01:34:59.000Z
1,"I have been a Vodafone customer for over 15 years now and this is by far the worst customer experience I have ever had to go through. I state the years, as it counts for absolutely nothing to them. Unfortunately, when companies are so big, it is easy to fall between the cracks and you are truly just a number (no pun intended). I went for a simple upgrade on the 14th April and my new phone was meant to turn up the next day. No phone, no update, just DPD telling me that it was delayed in transit. Over the next couple of days, Vodafone had no update for me. I was then told that I had to wait for 6 working days for DPD to do a full investigation. On the 6th working day, I called Vodafone and they confirmed it had been lost (the phone call was an hour and 20 mins long and I was on hold for an hour and 10 mins of that time and not once did the agent come back on the line). I eventually got the chance to ask if they can send a new phone now, seeing as the outcome had been confirmed, which they said no. They have to close down the matter their side and a further escalation has to happen within Vodafone and that I'll get a phone call within 2 working days. A few days later, my phone call never came from the escalation team. By this point I am now 2 weeks without a phone and have spent over 4 hours on live chat and phone calls. I emailed over a very candid message and someone called me within 20 mins of that message. I was told to wait 2 more days for them to close the order and that they would call me. The 2 days passed on Friday 2nd May. I am still awaiting a new phone with tomorrow marking the 3 week anniversary. I write this review to not only show the ineptitude of Vodafone and their complete and utter lack of care for their customers but also so people contemplating upgrading or using Vodafone for the first time, to reconsider and go elsewhere, it's just not worth it, even just for their protocols alone. You will be left and forgotten about. Edit: to respond to the comments below and for clarity to the reader, this is an official complaint and was raised on the 25th April. It's now the 6th May.....still no response.",Mike,GB,2025-05-06T13:21:19.000Z

1,"I want to get this out there with anyone who is thinking of joining vodafone or are currently either with them or disconnecting from them... when you're with them, things seem to be okay, no issues unless you need customer support, but by christ, you need deep pockets if you're thinking of leaving.. my partner has been stung twice in this situation. Once with her phone, secondly with her WiFi. On both occasions vodafone had mentioned that contracts have been completely paid off but later on emailed her demanding money months later down the line. With a bill of exactly ¬£178 twice! Not one warning...not one warning at all, nearly setting her back ¬£500 on contracts that together dont reach ¬£60 a month! Absolutely rubbish customer service! But a company thay simply takes money from people with no care in the world, sort it out.. disgusting. Don't go with vodafone if you want your moneys worth for anything. Go to EE they offer better coverage too",Jack Evans,GB,2025-05-05T20:32:07.000Z

1,Awful service provider and worse network coverage. I have been charged for more than 9 months for not using my mobile broadband. I visited the office and the manager told me he can't help me. I contacted customer care and there were even more unhelpful. I filed a complaint and absolutely nothing has been done. They make promises and dont keep them and i am fed up. I don't understand what service at all they provide.,SON OF MAN,GB,2025-05-05T10:39:46.000Z
1,Awful network. Used to be brilliant. In last 18months absolutely rubbish. If there was a option for 0 star I'd give it. Customer service is average. Even 3 network has better service and you can hardly get through to them.The signal is atrocious! Networks like 02 and ee have improved massively in comparison to vodafone in the past 3 years!Sort your signal out vodafone as people are moving on to other networks!,Mo Kara,GB,2025-05-05T00:54:06.000Z

1,"My elderly parents decided to go with Vodafone after seeing reviews. They have been with Vodafone for broadband since August 2024 and last night around 8pm the broadband went down. After calling them this morning 8.30am my father advises no internet since 8pm previous evening. I call Vodafone who obviously won‚Äôt discuss anything (GDPR) I ask them to call my father and they do. Trouble shooting for hours and not getting anywhere . Various calls to and from Vodafone, probably between us six to eight calls and yet it‚Äôs now 5.22pm and still no internet. My mother has a heart monitor machine for her ICD that requires internet,  being elderly they rely on broadband for tv and to use video calls and check their emails, they‚Äôre pretty much cut off. They are visiting the Vodafone shop tomorrow to see if they get anywhere as there‚Äôs onlySo many times they can go through the troubleshooting, reset machine turn off and on, put a pin in the pin hole of the router and wait etc etc‚Ä¶.. not sure when they plan to sort it or even if they plan toBut these guys are unbelievable , never had customer service so bad",Carolyn Williams,GB,2025-05-04T18:27:51.000Z

I can‚Äôt log in because I don‚Äôt have a number.Another phone call to customer services and was told that they ‚Äòcan‚Äôt do anything until you get the bill‚Äô.

1,"I stupidly stuck with vodafone at contract renewal, despite their service being routinely rubbish. They sold me a brand new iPhone which continually crashes. To begin with, it crashed once every two weeks, but now, 3 months later, it crashes every 2 days, and they will do nothing about it, other than to take my phone away from me to send it away to get ‚Äúfixed‚Äù.

1,"Dreadful customer service. I have been with Vodafone for both my mobile and broadband for more years than i care to remember. I could view both my mobile and broadband bills on the app, a good service.That was until i bought another mobile contract from another provider but it was a totally new contract with Vodafone.All of a sudden I had a problem. I could only view my mobile bill, i didn't receive my together discount which they promote if you have both mobile contract and broadband contract with them, i also dont get the together offers on the app, these are the bonus offers on Myvodafone app. For nearly a full year now I have spent an inordinate amount of time on live chat(2 hours at a time) attempting to get them to merge both my broadband and mobile to one account. Yesterday 1 spent another 1.5 hours on to their customer services, they passed me between different depts, one told me he couldnt merge my accounts as i had to fill in a form asking them to merge both accounts. I filled in this form 8 months ago and told him that. He then kept me waiting 15 mins whilst he checked, he then confirmed i wasn't lying and they had the form but nothing had been done with it!! Next he told me he'd have to transfer me to another department as my credit check was outdated???? What? I have had my mobile with vodafone for around 15 years, broadband for 5 in my current home.He was basically fobbing me off, i dont think he knew how to merge the accounts. How hard can it be? I asked to speak to his Manager, he kept me waiting 10 mins then asked me to explain what i thought his Manager could do for me? At that, I gave up. I told him it'd be easier to take my business elsewhere, they are nowhere near the cheapest anyway. I wouldn't under any circumstances recommend vodafone to anybody due to their complete lack of customer care. In fact I'd go further and actively discourage anybody i know from using them, simply because of a complete lack of interest in a customers needs.Please go elsewhere because if you don't have a ridiculous amount of spare time to talk to their customer services, you have no choice but to resigb yourself to the fact, issues will not be sorted by vodafone. Dreadful company. I'll find a new provider this weekend, i give up on them. My mobile will move too when i'm out of contract.  ***UpdateVodafone have responded, unbelievably they spelled my name incorrectly and even more unbelievably, they have suggested I contact them, by LIVE CHAT would you believe. My god, what has happened to this company. Kind regards BRIAN. Not Brain",Brian Oneill,GB,2025-05-04T16:39:56.000Z

1,"Do not choose Vodafone Broadband. Until recently I had been happy with my home broadband, but in the past couple of weeks dealing with the service has become a nightmare. Apparently someone (unknown, certainly NOT me) requested a new provider so Vodafone contacted me ""sorry you're leaving etc etc). I contacted customer service, tried phone and then resorted to the online chat service, and after numerous different agents was eventually reassured that this was all an error and my service would not be disconnected, however as of yesterday I have no broadband at home and despite wasting another couple of hours between chatbots and phone (I was cut off the call after 40 minutes!!) I am no further. I cannot work from home and they are apparently going to bill me ¬£111.39 as an early termination fee for a disconnect that I have explained repeatedly I did not request. Noone seems to be able to sort this out, and they called it a 'seized line' I was offered a whole new account and a 2 week wait for what should have been a continuous service. Dealing with this company is one of the most frustrating experiences.*UPDATE* Now almost three weeks before connection and as I do not have a Vodafone mobile they have washed their hands of providing me with any alternative in the interim.  Apparently company policy precludes sending me anything like a wifi dongle. That would be too useful.  I also have to contact them again when the termination fee appears as they will have to manually reverse it. I have had to set up an entirely new account. This has taken about 7 hours of online chats; almost a whole working day. I could weep.",Michelle,GB,2025-05-04T19:24:45.000Z

1,"Vodafone must be the worst company for broadband so far. Was promised to get connected on 28th of April and so far on May 2nd no Internet. I work from home so this is incredibly frustrating having no access to the Internet.  Having been on the phone to them more than 10 times, they're no closer to solving the problem than in the beginning. Initially they blamed open reach before admitting that the "" order hasn't been completed"" by them despite having sent all the necessary equipment and not once during setup did they mention that they would need to be called. I called them again and requested to speak to the manager in which I was promised a phone call but many hours later no one called me. Still without Internet for the weekend. Very shambolic company. I wouldn't wish Vodafone broadband on my worst enemy. To add salt to the wound, apparently I can't cancel the contract until it's services is live, hence I'm at their mercy. Avoid like a plague.",Dami,GB,2025-05-02T23:00:50.000Z

1,"Never use Vodafone! I have never actually used Vodafone, but after my partner‚Äôs experience I certainly NEVER will! He has had the worst possible experience from a huge and well known company. They charged him for 2 broadband packages without his knowledge and their ineptitude in resolving a phone line not working resulted in his business missing important calls from customers. After multiple contacts with them and promises of compensation, he has had nothing. The latest in this farce is that the compensation owed cannot be sent to him due to admin errors! I would have thought that a multi million pound company would be able to sort such simple problems. What ludicrous customer service and how embarrassing for the staff that work there. It will be nice when one day we won‚Äôt have to complain about more Vodafone tomfoolery!",EllieLeech,GB,2025-05-02T15:58:12.000Z
1,"It got worse. The mobile was found to be ready after all, but when I got home and opened the box, someone had slung in the wrong kind of charger. I give up. The contract is getting cancelled. Who takes all that money and sets up a contract then supplies the wrong items? Well, it happens, but the level of argument from the team recommended by the response below is off the scale. No, they couldn't look up the details of the phone and simply send me a proper charger. It's a poor outlook in the event of more issues.***Everything happened quickly after Vodafone responded (below). Whereas the customer services adviser had said I couldn't collect the phone until tomorrow, suddenly a message came - it was ready after all. Having seen the laconic attitude in the Braintree store twice this week, I'd guess they simply couldn't be bothered to arrange collection today. Not until they got chased following my TP comments.***I'm waiting for a new phone which was promised for today. No text has arrived, and clearly, it isn't ready to collect. A call to customer services got me an email address and I sent a message, to which no one has responded from the shop in Braintree. Then a demand to fill in a survey arrived. The customer service assistant then called me, to urge me to fill it in. I explained, I had deleted it since the process was not complete, and she made me feel guilty. I suggested she might resubmit it but she was dismayed and said she could not. This isn't my fault. All I want is the proper service, which I was promised on Wednesday.",Lisette,GB,2025-05-04T01:51:25.000Z

After looking into it I was owed over ¬£300 by Vodafone who admitted an admin error and advised the refund would be back in my account within 30 days. 30 days go by, still no refund. I contacted Vodafone, again. To be told there was another admin error and the refund wasn't processed. I'd need to wait another 30 days for my refund. I advised this wasn't acceptable and I wanted a bank refund within 24 hours. This came to a deadlock with their only solution being, the refund will be back in 30 days.

We missed one call they did it at early morning 1min and 1 minute after. Your supposed to call around 5 hrs later etc if call in evening you would call the next morning etc. I contacted social media and they couldn't help just told me to phone.

1,"Absolutely useless, go elsewhere for your broad band, Mine should have been installed at the end of March delayed, delayed, delayed. Just been informed now it has been put back till June. Told I can only claim a maximum of 60 days of delay for compensation. So far 3 missed visits also. You cannot speak to anyone who can actually do something. All they can do is to apologise every time you phone. They have absolutely no idea of customer service. I asked that someone from customer services contact me to discuss the issues I have experienced. Told it was not possible. What has happened to this country!  Vodafone's reply to this and on my previous trust pilot review on the same issue was to contact the broadband team. I have done exactly that over the past two months about once or trice every week to find out what was happening and I got absolutely nowhere on every occasions. if customer service had taken the time to check out what had happen, they had my order number via trust pilot rather that responding with a meaningless statement suggesting I had done nothing to try and sort this out just shown what an appalling customer services they have.

1,Incredibly bad service when starting as a new client. I changed over to Vodafone and was told that my SIM would be available within 24 hours. Each time x3 now. 24 hours later it is still not activated. Still not done. Lying to me just to get me off the phone I reckon and I was polite. Don't follow up with their own work/system- calling in. Surely they know I'm a new client and need to get it activated? And now I've told to wait another three days. So 7 days of lost business as I can't receive any calls. Regretting joining Vodafone as they have cost my business dearly because of bad service and I have to beg them to activate my simm and get my number ported over to them.Update- had a reply to go on facebook - ??but please explain how the facebook team- (Thats if one has facebook) can actually help or was that just an automated reply?  UPDATE-2: Now 9 days to supposedly port my number to Vodafone. Lost business for me- They dont expadite this or try to get in touch. Vodafone keep moving the date forward each day- ??????,Andre Ordel- W,GB,2025-05-06T14:16:16.000Z

1,"Imagine you purchase an esim with service. Pay as you go plus to be exact. Upon esim activation, the phone shows ‚Äòno service‚Äô. Because you have no service youre unable to call vodafone support so have to use your daughters phone. You end up keeping daughters phone for 48 hours while vodafone agents tell lies like ‚Äúpay as you go plus does not work with an esim‚Äù in an attempt to sell you a monthly contract because you had to press 2 for the sales team in order to get help with your non working service because pressing 1 for pay as you go and choosing ANY of the 5 options leads to a recorded message saying ‚Äúthank you for calling Vodafone, goodbye‚Äù.  Then you finally call in to the sales team, get transferred to pay as you go, ask to put in a complaint so you can get it over with but the person gets an attitude at the word complaint and says ‚ÄúI need to take you through security in order to pass you to a manager or file a complaint but as soon as you do I‚Äôll either pass you over or file your complaint‚Äù. Then proceeds to ask 9 more security questions than the usual questions asked, even going as far as asking what was the last line of contact I used to contact Vodafone and name 2 previously called numbers and amount of last top up, in addition to name, address, phone number, date of birth, email, and first 2 of PIN. All in an attempt to frustrate because I mentioned complaint. Then once they‚Äôre in the account refuse to keep their word and insist on you giving them a chance because you‚Äôre ridiculous if you don‚Äôt give every single person you speak to a chance to do the same thing then say they can‚Äôt help then become rude and then hang up . I‚Äôm certain Vodafone trains their agents to do this to avoid getting complaints. The agents work you up by raising their voice or speaking to you like you‚Äôre stupid all while you are out the money you paid and now having to spend time on dealing with rude agents. So after I file a complaint asking for my PAC I recieve a call at 9:34pm from a lady who at first is so apologetic and tells me she understands. Then she starts saying she noticed I generated my PAC and asking what my next plans are and if I will stay with Vodafone. Saying if not she totally understands and will provide my PAC but she first wants to see if she can help. I tell her I‚Äôm not sure so she offers free data. Then she says due to a technical issue she can‚Äôt give the data. So I say I will top up tomorrow but can I have my PAC just in case and so I don‚Äôt have to talk to anyone else. As soon as I mention wanting my PAC her fake nice personality disappears and she‚Äôs now talking loudly and condescendingly and saying things like ‚ÄúYOU CAN SPEAK TO A MANAGER BUT THAT WONT CHANGE THE FACT OF ANYTHING, DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SAYING?? OH SO YOU WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH YOUR COMPLAINT, BRILLIANT, BUT SETTING EXPECATATIONS YOULL BE TOLD THE SAME‚Äù in a loud and rude voice. Same customer who spoke to her calmly and explained what I been through with Vodafone. So no way tomorrow will I top up. Vodafone will be added to the list of companies I will swear to never ever on any circumstance do business with. Imagine spending days with no service while Vodafone has your money and all the agents can do is gaslight and argue. More condescending language like ‚Äúthe phone lines only had a technical issue today, they aren‚Äôt always like that but maybe you also didn‚Äôt press the right options‚ÄùI then ask this lady when the last time was that she called Vodafone customer support‚Ä¶the answer? Never. She‚Äôs never called Vodafone customer support and she‚Äôs trying to tell me who‚Äôs been on the phone for the last 48 hours trying to get through to someone how a line she‚Äôs never called works. Her answer ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard reports. Clear lie. What customer support call center agent sits around monitoring ‚Äúreports‚Äù of the entire Vodafone customer support network? Not even the QA analysts do that. They monitor only conversations not the hardwares software uptime. Yet this call agent wants me to believe she does. I challenge every reading this, try it yourself. It is 100% impossible to call Vodafone customer support and choose pay as you go and get through to a human. You will be met with either a message saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôve sent this in a text, goodbye‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you for calling Vodafone, goodbye. The ONLY way you will speak to a human is of course if you press 2 for joining Vodafone which will put you through to some of the shadiest sales people. Careful because they will say anything, even slander their own network to run your credit. As this guy did. He knew my situation was stressing me out and yet he took it as an opportunity to take advantage of me and the bad situation. He thought if he told me pay as you go plus doesn‚Äôt work with an eSIM id sign up with him on pay monthly, no wonder he turned nasty when I insisted on speaking to pay as you go. Never ever again. Not even in next life.",Devres Weekes,GB,2025-04-30T23:53:54.000Z

I am at home most days recovering from major surgery, so do not have my security info to proceed with the call, and i am currently undergoing chemo. I then get asked for security info for my business account, I explained this was at the office, not with me and the guy had the audacity to ask me if I could go to work and get it!Sure, I'll just take my chemo drip and tootle off to the office shall I?What would have been a positive review has turned into a negative one having been pestered and harassed all day to do a customer experience survey having explained today was not a good day.Disgusting lack of empathy, understanding and service",Miss M,GB,2025-04-30T20:34:43.000Z

1,"Stay away from Vodafone, I tried to swap my broadband to them and it‚Äôs been nothing but hassle. I am now going to be without broadband for a week because they are incompetent, I swapped and gave a swap date 20 days in the future, they then decide to send out the equipment 2 days before the swap is due, DPD then didn‚Äôt even knock or ring and took my parcel to the post office. The post office has now shut for 2 days so I can‚Äôt even get the parcel, the customer service people were awful and provided no help and said it will take 5 days to send out new stuff or 5-6 days to cancel. They then lied to me several times and I have the transcript on me email to show this as when they were caught out they tried changing the subject. It‚Äôs not my fault they can‚Äôt send routers out in enough time. Obviously I‚Äôve opted for the cancellation and contacted Sky who have done me a better price and even tried to assist in my situation. If you actually want broadband don‚Äôt choose Vodafone!

1,"Absolutely the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had with a broadband provider. I contacted Vodafone to set up broadband at my new home. They offered me a broadband plan and upsold me two SIM plans on the promise of convenience and everything under one roof. Sounded fine‚Äîuntil the nightmare began.They gave me an activation date a full month out, and I had to chase them four separate times just to get my router shipped. When the activation date finally arrived, CitiFibre came out‚Äîonly to tell me installation wasn‚Äôt possible due to ‚Äútechnical reasons.‚Äù Two weeks later, we got an email saying Vodafone had cancelled the installation entirely.No one from Vodafone bothered to inform us directly. When I called for answers, I was met with shocking rudeness and indifference. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing we can do,‚Äù they said. After nearly two months of waiting, that‚Äôs all they had to offer.To make matters worse, when I asked to cancel the SIM plans‚Äîsince the only reason I got them was for a broadband package they couldn‚Äôt deliver‚Äîthey said I‚Äôd have to pay a ¬£150 early termination fee. Are you kidding me? You fail to deliver the service you promised, and I‚Äôm the one penalized?On top of that, trying to get help is like being trapped in a maze. You‚Äôre transferred from one person to the next until you give up. It honestly feels like they‚Äôve set it up that way on purpose.This company is a complete scam. They‚Äôll waste your time, your money, and treat you like an inconvenience for expecting basic service. I wouldn‚Äôt trust Vodafone with a free trial, let alone a paid contract.

1,"Couldn‚Äôt access my account as couldn‚Äôt receiver OTP‚Äôs, escalated it multiple times and they never fixed it. Got to a point where I had to leave and go to another provider as I couldn‚Äôt even activate my wifi boosters because I couldn‚Äôt login. Multiple staff saying completely different things, so clearly they‚Äôre not trained properly. Ended up going to the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù complaints department and they just asked to close the case because I was leaving anyway and refused to fix the issue. Left within the cooling off period, got told I wouldn‚Äôt be charged at all, and got charged anyway. Staff are absolutely useless and don‚Äôt read the notes, so you end up being on the phone explaining the same thing a million times even when you explain it to them, they just seem like robots, so they don‚Äôt actually listen to what you‚Äôre saying.",Real Life,GB,2025-04-30T18:22:40.000Z

1,"Oh my word! Is Vodafone the worst mobile operator ever or are they just part of a bad bunch! It's taken me months, including a nasty experience with a Vodafone appointed debt collector, to not yet have resolved an apparently outstanding debt - for an account I closed in 2017. And now, because I - strangely - cannot recall the pin number for that account, I have to go into a physical store with ID to progress this. Why on earth doesn't Voda invest in decent online verification? If banks, governments, and the NHS verify through decent technology why can't Voda? Frustrating, time-consuming, unhelpful, cheap. Surely there are better mobile operators out there.Edit: Vodafone was kind enough to respond to my review with sympathy but directing me to their online chatbot which I had already tried several times and which could not help me. It seems that the service agent had not properly read or understood my complaint and that it cannot be resolved until the issue with my PIN is resolved. Sending me to a madenningly unhelpful chatbot that then directs you to one of the worst AVR phone systems I have ever encountered has made this worse. Sorry Vodafone, nul points, again!",Barbara  J,GB,2025-04-30T20:06:49.000Z

1,"Signed up for broadband and then a few days later my current provider has offered a better deal, i called Vodafone to exercise my 14 days cancellation rights , first person did not sound sure of what he was doing but assured me that it was cancelled , I had no email confirmation which seemed odd.2 days later BT called me stating that the Vodafone switch over looked to still be going ahead !Called Vodafone again spent ages on the phone and was told ""it appears that everything has been cancelled including your accounts "" I asked for a email confirmation of this and the call taker said that you don't get confirmation of the cancellation, which seems ridiculous. The call taker assured me that the service has been cancelled, so I was hoping that this would be it, 1 day later I have a text from Vodafone saying that the direct debit has been successfully set up!!!I have canceled that with my bank but this is still preventing me from staying with BT as they say that the connection is still showing as moving to Vodafone !Call centre staff don't seem well trained and I am now stuck in a situation of wanting to cancel a contract in line with my statutory rights , won't touch Vodafone in future however good the deal.",Steven 451,GB,2025-04-30T16:16:44.000Z

Then they decided that the line to the house needed an upgrade and this was going to happen by Mar 28. They called us repeatedly up to this date and then nothing. I now have to call them every couple of weeks for an update with no target date for completion. The order does not show on our account as 'List of Orders' apparently only means 'List of Completed Orders' and not those in progress. Then they promised compensation and initially gave details of what was due. Now they are quiet on this as well.

1,"EDIT: After all of that my number never got ported and they couldn‚Äôt tell my why so it‚Äôs lost forever, and I woke up to find I had no access to data and they couldn‚Äôt tell me why either so had to do a disconnect reconnect, I went into the store and returned my phone and cancelled my contract. Couldn‚Äôt have had a more terrible experience I don't normally write reviews but,I have genuinely had the worst experience and I've gotten nowhere trying to get it resolved, I originally bought a base s25 in store, decided to return it for an S25 ultra while my number was being ported, but was never explained this could cause issues, so they let me sign up to a new contract and return the s25 once the Porting was cancelled and they could port it to the new contract, it has been a 2 week process of going back and fourth and calling and my number still hasn't been ported. This has affected my business as I have potentially lost hundreds of pounds as it is my business number my clients reach me on and taken up hours and days of my time of being in store or on hold and I keep being lied to by customer services who tell me it'll be done x day and it doesn't happen. if this isn't sorted I'll be leaving Vodafone and never using them again, they've treated me absolutely terribly as a customer and it just isn't good enough.

Vodafone Banbury was the only shop to have a display of the Samsung 9a it was also the only store where we were instantly approached by the staff member ewan.

His customer service was outstanding ‚Äî friendly, genuine, and above all, committed to making sure I left the store completely satisfied.

2,"I have been on their Full Fibre 910Mbps since January 2025. I am connected via ethernet directly to the Router supplied which is a Power Hub.Speeds using various websites are always inconsistent. I'll always get over 500Mbps (which is the guaranteed minimum) but very rarely hit the 900-1000 range. Ping is normally between 9-18ms. Speed and Ping is affected during peak times.The Power Hub is rubbish because I get a 'C' on Waveform bufferbloat. In online gaming the ping is erratic and also causes a lot of rubber banding.The wifi range is pretty good but not the greatest.To compare, I previously used Virgin Gig1 and Plusnet Full Fibre 900. Virgin was more reliable than Vodafone but I still had issues during peak times.  Plusnet was great overall. Consistent speeds between 900-980Mbps and Ping between 6-9. There was less noticeable difference at peak times.",P1,GB,2025-04-29T14:41:32.000Z

I lost my phone 3 days ago and since then it has been a nightmare to get a new phone. Went to store, they asked me to submit id verification forms which I did and since then their credit check just have been playing with me and asking to reapply and change my bank details! Why?? I have been paying on time for years and now you cannot pass my credit check because of bank details, are you serious??!! The manager and staff in Bond Street store was very rude and didn't want to help me at all, like figure out yourself. my case ref number is Case Reference: 11599634 in case if you are reading it.

1,"First of all, I want to make it clear that the customer service representatives themselves were not the problem‚Äîmost of them were polite and helpful when communication was clear. The real issue lies with Vodafone‚Äôs rigid company policy, which was used to justify every unfair charge and action. We all know that there are always exceptions, workarounds, or simply fairer ways to treat long-standing customers‚Äîbut Vodafone chose not to explore any of them.After being a loyal Vodafone customer for nearly a decade, I feel disappointed by the way I was treated during my service cancellation.I was charged for nearly two months after cancelling broadband due to moving, despite being out of contract. They used policy as justification, though the service wasn‚Äôt usable. The 80 Mbps line I was paying ¬£40/month for often underperformed, which I had to prove repeatedly before it was eventually fixed.My mobile plan was also overpriced, yet now I get the same service on Vodafone‚Äôs network through another provider for a fraction of the cost. I didn‚Äôt leave because Vodafone wasn‚Äôt available‚Äîjust because others offer better value.I used to appreciate Vodafone for its support and offers, especially for new customers. Sadly, loyalty doesn‚Äôt seem to mean much to them anymore.",Gilbert,GB,2025-04-29T13:06:19.000Z

1,"I moved to a new flat in December 2024, leaving the Vodafone broadband (which was under my name) at the previous property with my ex-partner. He wanted to take over the broadband, so I contacted Vodafone customer service. They told us both to be on the line to authorize the name change, which we did, and they confirmed the transfer would be completed in 2 days.That never happened.A month later, I was still receiving bills, and the transfer was never completed. My ex, frustrated by the delay, decided to cancel Vodafone altogether and sign up with a new broadband provider. I then contacted Vodafone via live chat and was told the service would be cancelled on 21st February 2025, and I wouldn‚Äôt be charged anything. That seemed like the end of it.But it wasn‚Äôt.Another month passed, and the broadband was still active. I reached out again, and they told me they couldn't cancel the service due to an ""open transfer request"" ‚Äî the very same one that should have been resolved months ago. I was told they would cancel the name transfer and then cancel the service, and I would receive a phone call. Instead, I got an email saying the name transfer was completed, which was completely the opposite of what was promised.By this point, my ex-partner had already joined another broadband provider, so this was just creating more confusion and unnecessary overlap. I called Vodafone again, but was told they couldn‚Äôt help me anymore as the service was no longer in my name. It became even worse when my ex called Vodafone and was told to go to a physical store and call again ‚Äî all of which we did, spending over two hours on the phone explaining everything all over again.To make matters worse, Vodafone told him he‚Äôd now need to pay a ¬£200‚Äì¬£300 cancellation fee, even though they were the ones who mishandled the entire process. We escalated the issue to the complaints department. Finally, someone from Vodafone called and sorted it out. They cancelled the service, waived the fee, and cleared the final bill, admitting none of these charges were ever supposed to happen.While I'm relieved it was eventually resolved, this whole experience was draining, time-consuming, and entirely avoidable. I lost countless hours chasing customer service agents, repeating myself, and trying to fix a mistake that was entirely Vodafone‚Äôs fault. I would never recommend Vodafone Broadband to anyone based on this experience.",Ali KD,GB,2025-04-29T12:50:54.000Z

1,"Terrible Service. Do not recommend it. Ordered a 4G Hub - did not work (connect to the internet) cancelled the next day, and upon receiving the return instructions the Hub was sent back asap. This was all within the cooling off period. They still charged us ¬£54.99. Worst ever. I had ordered similar mobile broadbands from EE and Three around the same time which did not work at the particular address these Internet Hubs were tried and when I attempted to cancel with them (EE, Thee) i had a much better customer service plus seems they have better policies - they wavered any charges, and cancelled it for free as nil services/broadband was used. When I contacted Vodaphone the circumstances of the situation was explained - additionally it was explained that there was nil usage of the services (which they could see and check) however despite this they charged this amount mentioned. Never going with Vodaphone again.",R. B,GB,2025-04-29T11:51:23.000Z

2,"The internet service itself is acceptable, but the devices they provide and the phone app are a nightmare.Their Wi-Fi extenders disconnect regularly, usually about once a month, and it becomes extra work for the user to reconnect them.Connecting these cheap devices requires using their phone app, which regularly breaks and fails to work.The router they provide cannot handle more than a few Wi-Fi devices, and you lose connection frequently. The problems get worse over time until you get fed up and call them. They fix it temporarily, but within a month the issues usually come back.If you only have one or two devices, and one of them is wired through an Ethernet cable, the service is okay.But if you have smart lights, cameras, multiple mobile phones, and computers, I would definitely not recommend Vodafone. They provide very cheap equipment that cannot support a modern home.Also, their prices go up every year. New customers get better deals, while loyal customers are punished.I will cancel my contract as soon as I have time to look for another provider.",John Akdogan,GB,2025-04-28T22:35:22.000Z

1,"I have been with Vodafone 30+ yrs and yet  they offer no discounts at all to loyal customers and they lie - they say all your chat is recorded, yet it wasn‚Äôt so thankfully I screenshot every word! I was lied to and told I could have a ‚Äúspecial deal‚Äù which is the exact same deal on the main website! I complained about the fraudulent info and manager said they will give me ¬£30 and close the complaint! ¬£30 to get my mouth shut! They also said my service was being dis connected at my request - I never requested this and purely asked what would happen if I chose to leave and take my number with me! He said I would get a PAC code but this never happened and instead they decided to lie and say I requested to leave on 26 May! When I complained today - the chat was no longer on my account, and I was told that the offers are to attract new customers! Therefore Vodafone only care about new customers and do not care whatsoever about existing ones and delete the chat when their commission is at risk!

1,"Shocking customer service. Was told my contract was up 2 months ago and needed to fill out a form to have my discount reinstated, was told i'd be contacted within 5 working days. Nobody ever contacted me and when i tried speaking to agents i was passed from pillar to post all obviously going off a script but every single agent telling me a different thing. Having reiterate my problem over and over again to 10 different agents and none of them understanding what im saying. Eventually calling them and being told to refill out the form again to see if it would prompt them to call me, dont understand why they couldnt just sort it out while i was on the phone to them. 2 weeks later and still no call so i raise a 2nd complaint. The complaints form asks you to choose a method of contact and both times i chose email, they phoned at 9pm the first time and completely disregarded my preference of being emailed. 2nd time had the exact same issue, blatantly obvious they arent reading the complaints properly because i did type this in caps as well as ticking the box. After telling the agent to email me because i was at work, i received an email saying my case had been closed as it had been resolved! It had NOT been resolved. Was just told once again to refill out the form, obviously not understanding that my complaint is about the fact i HAVE filled this form out and NOBODY HAS CALLED ME. I call the complaints line on my lunch break and again get absolutely nowhere. Agents very obviously reading off scripts and ticking boxes, not caring about what you're actually calling about and not understanding what you're saying.",Emma Ness,GB,2025-04-28T15:06:52.000Z

1,"When I queried an expense on my account, after getting through to a human who was very pleasant, she convinced me to leave TalkTalk and transfer to Vodaphone. She did not warn me that my extension phones would not be compatible or that there might be a delay in providing a landline service both things that are important to me.3 days after the exchange I called to say my phone wasn't working only to be assured that it would be in 24 hours, the following 2 days were exact repeats of this, finally, last Thursday I had a long conversation with another convincing agent who said she could ""absolutely guarantee that my phone would be fully working within 3 days"" of course 4 days later it still isn't. That is 12 days now without a functioning phone despite many assurances that it would be fixed overnight. When I tried to escalate a complaint I was fobbed off. Most of the agents, but not all, were respectful and helpful I was prepared to give the company a chance to make good but this experience has eventually proved very negative. I spent nearly an hour today with a Vodaphone tech guy on the phone and at the end he told me that my BT phone was incompatable with the router Vodaphone supplied, he advised me to buy a Panasonic phone. When I complained he said that he could offer me a ¬£5 voucher which I found insulting. Too angry to communicate further with this lot!!",John Dearling,GB,2025-04-28T20:26:41.000Z
1,Changed my mind on purchase of phone within 14 day cooling off period and cancelled contract. Am being chased for unpaid bills for a phone I never received and Customer Service were next to useless in helping me and suggested that I must have used a phone I never received to be getting charged. Clearly the process of cancelling a contract is not communicated to other relevant departments and now I have to go into a Vodafone shop for an online purchase and take time off work. Very frustrated.,Catherine,GB,2025-04-28T12:58:32.000Z

1,"Struggled for 3 years going to Spain. Vodafone my UK provider & switches to Vodafone ES while there. However, indoors in Barcelona reception abysmal - very common problem. Locals shrug shoulders & say - Si, no one uses them!  In 2025 Vodafone ES DOES NOT support WiFi Calling. Had to change provider in Barcelona & revert to Telefonica/O2/Movistar on Spanish mobile. O2 competitive internet/mobile deals but more importantly WiFi calling available. Diff between 3 bars indoors against ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ or 1 bar. Now will switch to O2 or equivalent in UK. Vodafone: thank you for prompt response. Regrettably a more considered response would have been more effective. Tried 1st option, Chat link. As expected standard bot with fixed drop down box - mobile not on list. No help at all. When I have time I‚Äôll waste time on 2nd option. In meantime will look for alternate service. FYI Spanish O2 SIM only, with WiFi calling in flat 3 bars; UK SIM Vodafone ES (for Vodafone UK), with/without WiFi calling no bars simply ‚Ä¶. No reception at any level.",Ana,GB,2025-04-30T07:47:08.000Z

When I explained that I couldn‚Äôt call Customer Service because my SIM wasn‚Äôt working, they just shrugged and told me to use someone else‚Äôs phone - no attempt to actually help.The second visit was just as bad. I went in to get a replacement SIM and asked a member of staff if I could use the gadget to change it over. Instead of helping, she told me she didn‚Äôt have one and to go ask one of the other managers myself.

1,"I am so disappointment and frustrated with the poor customer service I have received regarding my faulty phone and return/exchange process. Despite numerous attempts to resolve the issue, I have been met with inefficiency, confusion, and contradictory information.I was sold a faulty phone and have been trying to return it for over a week. I have been bounced between different people, stores, online platforms, and phone calls, with no clear resolution. Initially, I requested a non-like-for-like exchange, but was later told this wasn't possible without significant hassle and additional requirements, including losing my number, obtaining a new SIM, and undergoing a credit check.After spending hours on the phone, I was informed that someone had accidentally processed a like-for-like exchange, leaving me with no option but to accept a phone I don't want. I'm now expected to take a day off work, wait in for a delivery on Tuesday, and then drive 30 minutes with my child to a Vodafone store just to return the new unwanted phone because we are not in the country from next Friday for a while. I will then need to request a PAC code and go look elsewhere for a phone. This experience has been unnecessarily complicated, time-consuming, and stressful. The last lady I spoke to I asked for a manager and got told he is only going to say what she is saying and that if I was leaving vodaphone anyway they can‚Äôt do anything. Definitely think before you consider getting a contract with vodaphone!!!",Georgia,GB,2025-04-26T11:39:08.000Z

1,"This is a second review after my previous experience. I've now being waiting over 5 months for my fibre broadband to be installed. I've had missed appointments. I still don't have a new date for installation and Vodafone now requesting that I have to reorder. After missing the last appointment over a month ago, after a 4 month wait, I raised a complaint. The online chat is useless. You have to get past an AI BOT. I then got out through to a customer service employee who couldn't help. She then forwarded me to the correct department. However, it turned out that this person was not able to assist either and I was forwarded to another customer service rep to assist. It really shouldn't be that hard to get in contact with the correct person without wasting so much time. The person I got in contact with gave completely false information why my order had been cancelled. When I challenged them their excuses and reasons for the cancellation changed. They were all lies. They were making it clear I was at fault for the cancellation of the order when I clearly was not. This was unacceptable. I raised a formal complaint and asked for the response to be email. Vodafone phoned me rather than email as I requested. The call started off fine. They apologised for the previous attempts to blame myself for the cancellation. She then went on to say that Openreach had cancelled the order, but they haven't said why. Previous Vodafone employees read specific reasons off their computer, but now she claimed there was no reason given. Surely Vodafone would want to know specific reasons why Openreach had cancelled a Vodafone customer's order? Surely having raised a formal complaint customer services would find out exactly what has gone wrong and why the order was cancelled? It seems like the most obvious thing to do.Vodafone are signed up to the automatic compensation scheme. However, the person handling my complaint said because it was Openreach that cancelled my order Openreach were liable for compensation. She said Openreach are refusing to pay me compensation. So she spoke to Openreach who are refusing to pay me compensation for the missed appointments and unacceptable delays, but she hadn't asked why they cancelled the order? Not believable is it? I pointed out that it's Vodafone that are responsible for the delays. My contract is with Vodafone and it's Vodafone that are signed up to the scheme. That's now multiple Vodafone employees that are making up lies to shift the responsibilities away from Vodafone. It's not a person making individual errors, it's a culture of people who are willing to openly lie to shift responsibility away from Vodafone. It's not acceptable.",customer,GB,2025-04-26T10:49:51.000Z

1,"I tried to upgrade my phone at the end of March, waited home all day on the arrival day and the phone never arrived. Since then I have spent, and I am not exaggerating, hours of my life speaking to various people (5 via the online chat and also through phone calls) who have assured me that the phone is coming within 72 hours). It has now been almost a month and no phone. About 2 weeks ago I cancelled the order/contract with 2 different people over the phone, who once again reassured me that it will be cancelled within 7 days. It has not been cancelled. So essentially, I cannot do anything or trust or rely on anyone. I will be switching my phone and Internet providers.",Vee,GB,2025-04-25T23:22:31.000Z

1,"I‚Äôve been left disappointed with my recent experience switching to Vodafone fibre.When the service was installed, I wasn‚Äôt informed that an external box would be fitted outside my property, which is quite unsightly. Due to the placement of this box, the engineer advised moving the modem to my entry lobby‚Äîthis has caused signal issues throughout the flat, with my TV in the living room frequently freezing and pixelating.Additionally, Vodafone didn‚Äôt send the necessary equipment for the installation. Thankfully, the engineer was helpful and provided a cable from their own van so the install could go ahead.I was sold this package on the promise of faster speeds and better value compared to my previous contract. However, after giving it a week to test, the connection has been consistently slower. As someone who works from home, this has impacted my ability to work effectively.When I raised these concerns, I was disappointed that rather than taking responsibility, the only solution offered was to purchase additional equipment to improve the signal‚Äîsomething that was never mentioned during the sales process.Overall, I feel the service hasn‚Äôt lived up to the promises made, and I hope sharing my experience helps others make an informed decision.",Constanza Bustamante,GB,2025-04-25T21:24:58.000Z

1,"I have had a really disappointing, expensive and frustrating experience trying to use a Vodafone pay as you go sim. I bought this sim as I simply wanted a pay as you go phone to use for work calls. I initially tried to top up ¬£10 credit. It all¬†appeared to be working fine until my bank notified me they'd blocked my debit card as it noticed fraudulent activity on my account. I had to call my bank who explained to me that over ¬£40 had been deducted from my account as the sim card was now treating me as a contract customer, rather than just a top up pay as you go. I went through the inconvenience of having to wait for my new debit card and the faff that comes with that. I called Vodafone who, to their credit, were helpful on the phone and I was relieved I could speak to someone who could help resolve the issue. It then seemed like the issue was resolved but then a month later I found out my credit was all used up even though I'd not made that many calls. I'd received confusing texts from Vodafone saying 'This is to let that your current ¬£10 Big Value Bundle runs out tomorrow...' with some more information.You would think that a pay as you go sim would just mean you pay as you go and top up when you're out of credit? It shouldn't be this complicated. I was happy to continue though as they operator had been helpful and I'd already invested time into this sim and I was hoping it would work out.I called them and again I was relieved to speak to an operator who was very helpful. I explained what had happened and also with the inconvenience of my cancelled¬†bank card and the Vodafone operator apologised and said I'd be given a voucher as compensation for the inconvenience I had experienced. They said this voucher would be sent to me via text. The operator also tried to explain something about how the call allowance on my phone wouldn't carry over to the next month, and there was a different plan I could do to make sure it did. I didn't fully understand this process and I was busy so I left it there and then planned to call back a month later to check I had balance and see what to do next.¬†The compensation voucher never arrived so I called Vodafone yesterday to see where the voucher was and also to check that I had call allowance because I have many work calls to make today and so wanted to ensure I had a working phone.The operator assured me I had credit on my phone and could use it until the credit ran out. I mentioned the confusing payment plan and also asked about the missing voucher. He said I'd need to go into a Vodafone store to claim the voucher. This is not what I was previously advised. I asked again and tried to explain that I was told I would receive it via text and he quickly became rude and condescending. He also didn't seem happy with me trying to understand the confusing payment plans and which added to his short and condescending¬†manner.This was so unexpected and frustrating when the reason for my call was because I was simply trying to check whether I had enough balance to make calls and also to see where the missing voucher was.The closest Vodafone store to me is a 45 minute round trip (just for the travel, not taking into account how long I would have to spend in the store trying to claim the voucher). The store is also in a direction that I have no reason to go in. I was offered this voucher due to the inconvenience I'd already experienced - what sense does that make that I'd then have to spend an hour to go and retrieve it? Especially after being told by the Vodafone operator that I would receive it via text. If Vodafone can take over ¬£40 of my money electronically, resulting in my bank having to block my account due to suspected fraudulent activity, ¬†then why can't they send me a voucher electronically? Especially when that's what I'd been told would happen.I haven't been able to make any calls today as my phone isn't working and I've checked my balance and it says I have no credit/call allowance. The condescending operator assured me yesterday I had calling allowance on my phone and became more rude when I tried to recheck that this was definitely the case.Having a Pay as you go sim should not be this time consuming, expensive and difficult! I'm stuck now as I don't have a working phone so I'm now having to make phone calls from my personal phone whilst withholding my number.  This looks suspicious and unprofessional to any clients receiving my calls. ¬†It also means a lot of the people aren't answering the phone to my withheld number.I know this is lengthy feedback but I want to make sure Vodafone are aware of this issue. I would not expect this from such a well known company.Hopefully warning others of all of the wasted time, money and energy I've experienced will help other people from having to go through the same.",Tara Campbell,GB,2025-04-25T13:38:47.000Z

1,"It is with considerable relief that I can finally state that my three-year entanglement with Vodafone Business Broadband has reached its overdue conclusion. To characterise this experience as merely disappointing would be a gross understatement; it has been a protracted and frankly infuriating ordeal. From the outset, specifically the first six months, the service left the traps at a state of near-constant dysfunction. The signal quality ranged from utterly useless to marginally poor, rendering any semblance of reliable business operations virtually impossible.These first 6 months were punctuated by a seemingly endless cycle of contacting customer support, enduring lengthy and often fruitless troubleshooting attempts, and repeatedly explaining the persistent and debilitating issues. Each interaction was a drain on valuable time and resources, yielding little to no tangible improvement in the abysmal service. Promises were made, investigations were supposedly launched, yet the fundamental problem of an inadequate and unreliable connection persisted.The fact that I remained a customer for the entirety of the contract term is a testament to the inertia that can sometimes accompany business services, not to any satisfaction with the offering. Looking back, those three years represent a significant waste of both financial investment and, more critically, operational efficiency. The consistent lack of a stable and dependable internet connection undoubtedly hampered productivity and introduced unnecessary stress into our daily workflow.Therefore, my departure from Vodafone Business Broadband is not just a change of providers; it is a liberation. I would strongly advise any business considering their services to proceed with extreme caution and to thoroughly investigate the experiences of other users before committing to what, in my case, proved to be a protracted and profoundly unsatisfactory relationship. Today is indeed a good day, marking the end of a costly and unproductive chapter.",Tim Blackmore,GB,2025-04-25T12:26:20.000Z

So after 8 months with them, my bill is increasing nearly 12% within the first year and then 23% at the 20 month point. What an absolute con in thinking you are getting a good price.

Their method to resolve it? Me reviewing the service and reporting on how awful it is each day! Like it will resolve itself by some miracle. Nope Vodafone, it's still not working !!

1,"Absolutely horrendous phone company to use. They are just money making and don‚Äôt care about customer experience. They do not listen, and dangerous to use abroad as my data never works and there responses are to not listen to what I say, or don‚Äôt help, baring in mind this has happened 3 times since leaving the country and yet is done to resolve the problem. They are now refusing to help now I‚Äôm back in the country, and are saying I need to wait until i‚Äôm next abroad, which just makes no sense as when I was abroad absolutely no help towards me was done what so ever. Counting down the days till i get my new phone and never have to use this company again.",Jess Mercer,GB,2025-04-24T17:59:23.000Z

3,"I've been using Vodafone UK for a while now, and my experience has been mixed. On the positive side, their coverage is generally reliable in most urban areas, and the internet speed is decent when the signal is strong. Their mobile app is also easy to use and makes managing my account simple.However, there are a few downsides that affected my overall experience. The customer service can be slow and sometimes unhelpful, especially when dealing with more complicated issues. I also noticed that the signal can drop or weaken significantly in more rural or less populated areas, which is frustrating when you rely on mobile data.Pricing is fair, but not necessarily the most competitive compared to other providers offering similar services. Overall, Vodafone UK gets the job done, but there‚Äôs definitely room for improvement, especially in customer support and rural coverage.",Pink Power Ranger,GB,2025-04-24T16:41:04.000Z

1,"Vodafone for a phone contract, whilst a bit more pricey, is generally OK.However... the broadband... terrible. The worst broadband I've had. The connection is not stable and despite me constantly calling up to report it, it got to the point the WiFi was disconnected more than it was connected. I was then promised a booster by Vodafone within 3 working days ... 10 days later had not arrived. Vodafone informed me it was showing as delivered which is likely to be a lie as then would not show me any proof of order or delivery, and I had no messages from the delivery company. I have now cancelled and gone with another broadband provider. Don't waste your money or time!",Chloe  Collins,GB,2025-04-24T12:46:06.000Z

I also needed help with proof of purchase and I was told ""that phone isn't on your account"". I went to the galleries branch straight after and dealt with Natalie who was fantastic! She confirmed no system issues with sim swaps and done them for me. She also helped me complete the proof of purchase form and confirmed that the handset and order was intact on the account. It was also confirmed that the issues were with click and collects orders, unlike I had been advised. If I could give less than 1 star I would. The girls in the shop just did not want to help me or need retraining. A huge shout out to the Washington store and in future if you need to visit locally that would be the recommendation.",Chris Wood,GB,2025-04-23T21:21:18.000Z
1,"14 Days without internet from Friday 24th Jan to Saturday 8th of Feb.I checked the Vodafone website on the 24th when servicer went down and on the area checker it said there was a network fault in our area and they had engineers working on it.The following week after still having no internet, I call Vodafone to chase up what is happening and state on my call that the internet has been down since the 24th of Jan.I am informed of the automatic compensation scheme and that I would receive compensation for each day I am without broadband after the first 2 working days of the internet going down, and that payments would be made automatically within 30 days.It is now April, and I have yet to receive any compensation.I've made numerous calls to Vodafone to chase up, this week I finally manage to speak to someone who reviews my account and informs me no one has processed anything for the compensation (good to know my previous calls were a waste of time) I am then informed that actually they are only going to pay me from the 1st of February as despite their system saying the internet went down on the 24th of Jan, they would not count it as being out of action until the day I called them. Then despite telling me they have no record of when the service was restored and I told them it came back on the 8th, miraculously they then have a note which says service came back on the 6th (false, we had 3 full Fridays without service, very easy to remember when you have two kids complaining constantly!)So far this week I've made 9 phone calls, spent several hours talking to different people, and am still waiting.Todays call from a manager has blamed me for not calling them when the service went down, I explained their own website said they knew of the issue and I didn't know I had to call to confirm, but was spoken down to for not ""self reporting""Avoid this absolute shambles of a company at all costs.",vanessa Shaw,GB,2025-04-23T21:03:53.000Z

1,"Worst deals and customer service ever experienced!I took a contract with them two years ago, and despite it being a contract, my monthly bill kept increasing by a lot and there was nothing I could do! It started with about ¬£34/35pcm and ended up around ¬£52! My contract finally ends tomorrow, so I decided to give them a call today to switch to a no-contract option, because I'll never get locked into a contract with Vodafone ever again. First, the agent kept pushing for a new contract, despite my saying multiple times that I want a pay-as-you-go, no-contract plan. Then, I was also told I'd have to pay a final bill because it was apparently my job to give vodafone a 30-day notice. Mind you, I didn't try to cancel or terminate my contract early, I just simply wanted to switch plan now that the current contract was over. I asked the agent what type of pay-as-you-go plans they have and was told that I will need to call 191 about that.Anyway, long story short, I decided to go for a no-contract cause I'm abroad at the moment, but as soon as I'll be back to the UK I'll switch providers.",Alessandro,IT,2025-04-23T18:23:35.000Z

1,"I recently had one of the worst customer service experiences, and I‚Äôm truly disappointed with how things were handled.When a customer decides to leave and requests to port their number, the process takes a minimum of three days. Despite this, you continue to charge more than half of the airtime cost. If this is part of your policy, it should be clearly communicated to the customer‚Äîespecially when auto-debit is active, and they are cancelling mid-plan while closing the account.It‚Äôs frustrating that companies as large as Vodafone allow customers to immediately settle device payments, but offer no straightforward option to cancel direct debits. We are forced to chase after your teams for 10 to 15 working days just to stop a payment this applies to airtime charges as well.In an age where technology is so advanced, it's unacceptable that there are no simple solutions for these basic issues. What‚Äôs worse, your customer service representatives don‚Äôt seem trained or equipped to explain the process properly, leaving customers confused and frustrated.It might just be a matter of ¬£5 or ¬£10 for a single customer, but when this happens to thousands or lakhs of customers, it adds up to a significant and unfair profit at the customer's expense.I hope this feedback is taken seriously and improvements are made‚Äînot just in the system, but in how your team handles and communicates with customers.",So,GB,2025-04-23T14:50:30.000Z

After a few weeks I was told that there was an issue and it hadn't gone through, but they would do it that day so I should get it within 7-10 working days again, this did not happen again, so when I had to go on ""TOBI"" again, I was told there was no complaints department/procedure but they get feedback and training provided again!!!!

1,"I‚Äôm so disappointed to have to write this review, especially as I have been a LOYAL Vodafone customer for around THIRTY YEARS, but sadly the treatment that I have received recently has left me no option.To cut a very long story as short as possible, I had been querying my bills for around 10 months as they were ridiculously high and I was passed from pillar to post and eventually I received a call from someone called Reece who is a case handler in their Specialist Care team, who spent a lot of time going through everything with me and he found that I was correct and I had been paying for something which I didn‚Äôt have and the long and short of it was that Vodafone owed me just over ¬£1,500 and an apology !!! Reece was very nice and he did apologise and was also able to remove the bad credit reference had been put on my file.He advised me that the money would be in my account within 10 working days. 10 working days came and went, still no money. I contacted Reece again and this time was told that an error had been made and he had requested the amount of ¬£15,500 to be refunded to me and that had obviously been refused. He admitted that he had made a mistake and confirmed that the next BACS payment roll would be done on the 21st April. Once again no money was received. I again emailed Reece, who had now stopped responding and someone called Mohammed replied saying I had to wait a further 10 working days. I explained that this really was not acceptable and I had been caused enough stress by Vodafone. I have previously suffered a stroke and when I tried to speak to someone this morning, the first call handler was so unhelpful and initially told me I wasn‚Äôt the account holder !!! I have asked if there is any way in which this payment can be made to me sooner. We are not in the 1970‚Äôs and we all know that a payment can be made by the click of button, however, Vodafone don‚Äôt have this option. I‚Äôm sure if I owed Vodafone this money, I would have been cut off by now.I did ask if he could please contact the so called ‚Äúback office‚Äù, which is where the payment is made from and explain the following:A LOYAL 30 year customer was overcharged and it has taken 10 months to resolve this.A LOYAL 30 year customer had a bad mark put on her credit file.A LOYAL 30 year customer was supposed to have her refund of over ¬£1,500 refunded to her by the 15th April but Vodafone made a mistake and put it through as ¬£15,000 so it was refused. A LOYAL 30 year customer will potentially have waited 20 working days for a refund which they are entitled to. However, he said he wasn‚Äôt able to do this and no one could contact the ‚Äúback office‚Äù, which I don‚Äôt believe. So, basically there is nothing I can do but sit and wait a further 10 working days, making it a total of 20 working days for Vodafone to refund money they owe me, and to be honest I‚Äôm not even confident that the payment will be made. I have lost all faith in VodafoneI haven‚Äôt asked for compensation or anything, just what is rightfully mine.  I currently have 5 lines with Vodafone, and will be changing providers, because if this is how they treat a customer who has been loyal to them for nearly 30 years, I dread to think how they will treat others. Complaint Reference: 131942729My response to Vodafone‚Äôs comment below. Who would you like me to reach out to because apparently the only people who can help are the so called ‚Äúback room team‚Äù are not contactable ?",Roz Page,GB,2025-04-22T15:08:48.000Z

1,"While entering the US, my on-flight wifi got disconnected and was connected to Vodafone 4g accidentally way before we landed and without even using the internet, just because it was connected to the network, I was charged for 7.86¬£ for the full day. It tried to speak with the customer service so that they removed the charge and they weren't able to help.I consider this a very bad behaviour towards a customer of nearly 10 years, and I will change provider as soon as my current contract expires.",Christos,GB,2025-04-22T14:00:34.000Z

1,"Vodafone has caused me so much stress over the years I‚Äôve been on contract with them. First of all, they had troubles taking out my direct debit so i was consistently getting charged for late payment fees, funny how that came out of my account just fine! It messed up my credit score when it wasn‚Äôt my fault.Then, I cancelled the direct debit and began to pay manually each month through the app. The app would glitch and wouldn‚Äôt allow me to view the ‚ÄúMy Billing‚Äù section, which caused more stress when paying my bill every month! Then, I finally cancelled the contract and had one more bill to pay. I informed the agent on the phone that I would be leaving the country and travelling for four months. During this time, I was unable to access the Vodafone App to pay my bill, because it would send a code to my old number, which had now been cancelled and was no longer receiving texts or calls. I couldn‚Äôt pay via the phone because I‚Äôm in a foreign country. Finally, I was able to figure out how to pay my final bill. But the stress is still not over! Vodafone is charging me ¬£5 for a late payment fee from that final bill. And I‚Äôm having the same issue, unable to pay it via the app or via the phone. Every time I call and receive help from an agent, it is VERY RARE that i actually have the problem solved. I feel genuine excitement for when I finally pay vodafone and i will no longer be contracted to them! It will be such a relief!I have wasted SO MUCH money to Vodafone. I would NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE !!!!!!",Sophie Anna,GB,2025-04-22T05:22:52.000Z
1,"I‚Äôve had an appalling experience with Vodafone, and I can confidently say this is the worst service I have ever encountered.For over a month now, my internet has been extremely unreliable, going down multiple times a day everyday, for over an hour at times. Despite spending over 10 hours on the phone with customer support, I have yet to see any resolution.I have additional needs flagged on my account, but this seems to make no difference whatsoever. Vodafone's customer service, internal processes, communication, and technical support have been nothing short of chaotic.I‚Äôve been passed between multiple teams, given false information, and even told that the constant disconnections were ""healthy."" I‚Äôve gone through the same troubleshooting steps numerous times, repeating myself over and over, yet the company is unwilling to acknowledge any fault.Meanwhile, I‚Äôm still expected to pay for this unreliable service, and when I mentioned leaving, I was met with passive-aggressive readings of my contract and that I will have to pay to exit the contract. I‚Äôve fulfilled my obligations by paying for the service, yet the service itself doesn‚Äôt work, and I‚Äôm being made to feel like the one at fault.I was even told to contact City Fibre, despite them having already visited on behalf of Vodafone and confirming the connection was fine. My contract is with Vodafone, not City Fibre, and they should be sorting this out, not passing the responsibility elsewhere.I‚Äôve been promised multiple callbacks, but rarely have they materialised. Additionally, Vodafone is aware that I have no signal in my area and rely on WiFi calling, yet when I left my home with my young baby to call them, they refused to speak with me any further after spening 35 minutes talking to me, citing that I needed to be at home (even though I can‚Äôt make calls without WiFi). I have also been asked to use my own ethernet cable (at my cost) - i had to ask on a separate call for them to send me another one of their own, rather than being forthcoming about it. I am also now paying for EE WiFi available in my area in order to work as I cannot rely on Vodafone. Again, all at my costs. I have lost work time (as I work from home) as well as losing my hard earned money to pay for EE's public WiFi. All the while still paying Vodafone for their appalling internet service. Vodafone have never even offered any sort of compensation or reimbursement for their lack of service. I have even mentioned it but their staff are bound by strict rules where they can't actually serve their customers.There are many more examples of poor service I could mention, but frankly, I‚Äôm exhausted from repeating myself on multiple daily calls to Vodafone.It feels like I‚Äôm being scammed, and I‚Äôm left wondering at what point Vodafone will acknowledge their fault and breach of contract. I have over a month‚Äôs worth of evidence showing the service being down repeatedly, yet I‚Äôm still being charged and feel like I am being threatened with exit fees. It‚Äôs a clear example of a large corporation exploiting its customers, and it‚Äôs disgraceful.I strongly urge anyone to avoid Vodafone at all costs.P.S. the Internet went down during this review - so I had to write it all again. UPDATE:THEY NOW WON'T LET ME LEAVE WITHOUT EXIT FEES AFTER SAYING IF I WAS NOT HAPPY I COULD. DISGRACEFUL. I HAVE A BABY WITH ADDITIONAL NEEDS AND VODAFONE ONLY CARE ABOUT THEIR GREED - NOT THE CUSTOMER. I HAVE HAD TO MAKE YET ANOTHER PHONE CALL WHERE I HAVE HAD TO RESET THE ROUTER. BUNCH OF LIARS AND PEOPLE WITH FALSE PROMISES. NEXT STEP OFCOM. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.",Ben Tooke,GB,2025-04-22T13:22:14.000Z

However, everytime I accepted their offer it couldn't be processed due to some fault with my account, so I was informed. Apparently this fault couldn't be resolved even after 2 years!

Each time, I get all the way to the final page to submit the order, only to be hit with an error saying there‚Äôs something wrong with my details, without explaining what exactly.I called customer service and spent 30 minutes speaking to a representative who kept repeating that nothing could be done, and that they can‚Äôt process special offers over the phone. When I asked to speak to technical support or anyone who might actually help, I was told no such team exists. I also tried the online chat twice, but the agents were dismissive and uninterested. I practically had to beg for assistance, even though I found others online mentioning the same error ‚Äì still with no solution!The webchat team didn‚Äôt just refuse to help with sales ‚Äì they refused to help at all.	‚Ä¢	Can you connect me to someone who can explain the problem?

1,This has been hands down the worst activation experience I've had for switching broadband. Signed up on the 6th March which involved openreach having to install a new box. Raised some questions about the work needed which never got answered by openreach and Vodafone were no better. Had 7 calls with Vodafone about the status and each time I had to explain to them that I'm waiting on openreach to answer my questions. Each time Vodafone said they would chase and update me but they never did. Had my activation date pushed back even though the initial date was 5 weeks after sign up. The long delay has caused my current contract to run out and my monthly fee to nearly triple. I was hoping to avoid this by switching in time. Vodafone have not offered any compensation for the issues that I've had. In the end my activation was cancelled because Vodafone couldn't communicate with openreach properly. Unfortunately I cant recommend Vodafone broadband and would encourage people to look elsewhere.,DoomzDayCode,GB,2025-04-21T14:35:48.000Z

1,"Tried to upgrade to 900 fibre speeds from my current plan 5!! times but Vodafone won't let me upgrade and keep cancelling the upgrade as they don't want to pay the fee for the engineer to come and install the new fibre for existing customers!! But they're happy to do it for new customers?? No loyalty whatsoever, and when I try to cancel and move to another provider they're refusing to cancel and demanding the rest of the contract payment! Absolutely terrible service, would never recommend to anyone. Go with literally any other provider.",Lucas Booker-Munoz,GB,2025-04-21T11:59:08.000Z

1,"I switched away from Vodafone over a month ago, yet I‚Äôm still being billed for a service that should have been cancelled. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to resolve this via live chat, but the experience has been nothing short of frustrating‚Äîagents either cut the chat without resolving anything or give vague, dismissive responses.I‚Äôm now being charged over ¬£50 for something I shouldn‚Äôt be paying for, and I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll be charged again due to a 30-day notice period‚Äîeven though the delay is entirely due to Vodafone‚Äôs own failure to process the cancellation properly.It's impossible to get proper help or accountability from anyone. The lack of communication and basic customer care is shocking for a company of this size.Avoid Vodafone if you value your time, money, or sanity. Switching away is hard enough‚Äîbeing charged after you leave is just insulting.Update: The live chat experience has been incredibly frustrating. Replies are painfully slow, with long periods of silence (20 minutes for 1 reply) and no updates. Even worse, agents ask irrelevant questions, like ‚ÄúIs this about your broadband?‚Äù when I‚Äôve already clearly said multiple times that I‚Äôm making a complaint about my broadband. It feels like no one‚Äôs actually reading the messages.This just adds to the sense that Vodafone‚Äôs support is disorganised and dismissive. It's exhausting trying to resolve even a simple issue.",C.I,GB,2025-04-21T14:56:17.000Z

1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience with VodafoneI was a loyal Vodafone customer for several years, but my recent experience has been deeply disappointing. After submitting my cancellation notice and confirming it with a representative named Aaron, I was still charged for the final month. I even took the step of blocking the direct debit, yet the charge was processed regardless.The in-store staff were unhelpful and dismissive, showing little regard for customer concerns. This level of service is unacceptable and has left me feeling misled and frustrated.I cannot recommend Vodafone based on this experience.",Pete Setlik,GB,2025-04-20T19:32:30.000Z

1,"Disappointed is an understatement. Paying for 200mbps getting maybe 5mbps on a good day. The router cannot cover the whole home (2 up, 2 down) so I‚Äôve paid for a booster myself.

DO Not Use.Last summer I wanted to upgrade to fibre, they told me that i'd have to have a new line installed, this alone was met with issues, I had to get a new phone number, and a new line, vodafone then started to charge me for 2 broadband lines, both the fibre and the normal. I rang up on numerous occasions asking them to sort this out. I have just had my latest bill. Still charging me for 2 broadband lines. The idea this was supposed to be an upgrade. It's digusting, rubbish rubbish rubbish service. I have not had it resolved internally, This is an issue that has not been resolved in 30 days. They told me that the old line was going to be disconnected. I am furious.",Douglas Coid,GB,2025-04-20T11:31:11.000Z

5,"Thankfully Vodafone still employ HUMANS! I had survived days of disruption whilst upgrading my plan, (¬£!) router AND mobile! Alexa was suffering withdrawal systems as was I, my Ring security cameras, tv‚Äôs and calls. I was even reduced to raising my voice to a robot, demanding to speak to a human in response to: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm afraid I didn‚Äôt catch that‚Äô etc etc! Sleepless nights dreading the ‚Äòinevitable‚Äô loss of data whilst transferring from my -ancient battery -failing -iPhone to the new all singing and dancing 16e!I was not best pleased to have been provided with the new phone but no means of powering it up as the cable supplied was not compatible to connect to the house 3 pin plug! More delay, more expense and then a new case and the latterly advised ¬£25 in store transfer cost!In Worcester I arrived early as advised and sat with Tom. At first I thought he might be a nerd facing a non techie very old  failure! A meeting of 2 different worlds!?However he did recover his empathy and I was delighted because the transfer was completed much earlier than I had expected and he reassured me that nothing would or had been lost and sensing ‚Äòmy journey‚Äô had been long he said, smiling, he would not charge me!! üòä Tom: You ‚Äòdone good‚Äô ‚öΩÔ∏è!Relax , there is a life after the days of dread of changing all systems. Also MANY thanks to the humans employed by Vodafone in Egypt, Northern Ireland and South Africa, all were very supportive and helpful whilst explaining a different language!! Improvements?Start the contract once the new kit has been received and installed not instantly on sales negotiation ?Availability of a basic tutorial would have been good as the 16e is totally different to my iPhone 8!Maybe Apple could/ should have supplied a typical UK three pin plug connection ?",Mr S of Worcestershire,GB,2025-04-19T21:19:44.000Z

1,"Quick reply to the replyLOL- call us, almost impossible to get someone with any understanding of the company on the actual phone. You get outsourced support via chat that are helping 20 people at once, clearly, and know nothing about the company   I‚Äôve wasted a combined two working weeks minimum calling or chatting them.  Yesterday I chatted with an agent about returning the extra equipment and it was 43 minutes - they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything. I asked one question - tell me the serials or MAC addresses if the provisioned equipment, they wanted me to explain why I needed that info, then to go through a FOURTH security check. So, that‚Äôs going in a landfill sadly - they clearly have no record of sending it to me. Why should I care. ‚ÄîSwitched broadband. They sent me two modems, never arranged for the non provisioned. I lost 18% of my speed when I switched from BT. Told them there was a problem, in fact what it was (as a highly technical 30 year professional) - they argued, 8 months later they rewired when someone new moved in, speed fixed. The mobile signal connects almost nowhere in London.  Even if it says it is, it‚Äôs not. Trying to break the contract for failure to provide service. Their answer, report the issue when you‚Äôre in the spot that‚Äôs not working ‚Ä¶. How?!?!  Alternately, they want me resetting mobile settings on my phone whenever I change areas.  They just don‚Äôt have a clue. Their customer service is awful, they have terrible coverage, their broadband is weaker than the competition even using the same lines.  They don‚Äôt listen.  They don‚Äôt try to I absolutely HATE this company.  I can‚Äôt wait to move every service in November. Don‚Äôt be tempted by switch pricing. They‚Äôre the absolute worst.",Aphonic,GB,2025-04-20T17:35:08.000Z
1,"Having issues with our vodafone broadband, runs slow or drops out completel, plus home phone line crackling. Spoke with vodafone who said to reset router, done this countless times, no improvement. On our last call they said to look at serial number on incoming box and told us this model was the cause and would send an Engineer the following afternoon to replace. They came in the morning when no one home. Follow up phone call told us base now closed as no fault on line, as the fault happens most of the time they need to monitor it for a long while.Do not use vodafone broadband absolutely useless.",Trudi Pike,GB,2025-04-19T13:56:42.000Z

5,I was returning the device I bought in the Buchanan street store yesterday and Asad (East Kilbride store) made the whole process easy and managed to save me some money meaning I will continue to stay with Vodafone as a customer. Unfortunately in the Buchanan street store where I bought the phone yesterday didn't alert me to the fact I have outstanding money to pay on my old phone. If I had known this I would have looked at other options. Due to Asad alerting me to this it meant that I could trade in my old phone and upgrade to the pixel pro XL. This was hugely appreciated. It is not often nowadays you experience savings and Asad's knowledge enabled me to feel extremely valued as a Vodafone customer who has been with the company for 15 years and will continue to be.,Eireann Macdonald,GB,2025-04-19T12:56:50.000Z

1,"My broadband was installed by Open Reach on 3 April. I signed up for Broadband & Phone.I have had no landline or broadband in my bedroom (I live in a small 1 bed cottage).I have made over a dozen calls to Vodafone to be told on each occasion that installation is not complete. This is now 16 days with no landline or broadband in my bedroom and no one can or will tell me when this will be resolved.I have been waiting for call backs from their Technical, Retention, Customer Care & Cancellation departments, non of which have taken place.I cannot cancel the contract as ""installation is incomplete""My issues have apparently been escalated each time I call but this appears to be a.fob off tactic; nothing gets done.I am raising the issue with the Communication Ombudsman as they are happy to take payment but not provide the service.If I could give a no star rating or less, I would. Vodafone have the worst customer service I have been unfortunate to come across.UPDATE:It is now day 22 without a landline and limited broadband. I was contacted after my last review, assigned a ""specialist"", who was going to keep in regular contact until the issue was resolved.Apart from 1 email, I have had to chase them and I am still no further forward.Vodafone complaints procedure state they will ""keep in contact with you regularly until a resolution is found"" - isn't/hasn't happened.

1,"Let me start by saying that I have Vodafone broadband and have, fortunately, never had an issue. For this reason I recommended this company to my parents. How I wish I had not!The issue started with the new broadband not seeming to function on the day it was meant to go live. Fortunately I was at my parents house visiting on that day so was able to make ""first contact"" with Vodafone supposed customer service department. I spent over an hour on the line to the advisor videoing the setup of both the existing fibre inlet box and the router, changing cables, at the insistence of the advisor, and providing serial numbers of both units, requiring the movement of various pieces of furniture and inconveniencing my parents. After all this I was asked to send further pictures to an email address and that the advisor would get back to my parents between 8 and 9:30am the following morning as I explained that they had a hospital appointment that required them to leave home at 10am. Come the following day no phone call was received and I had to contact Vodafone again at approximately 2pm as the broadband was still not working and the promised phone call had not materialised! My brother, who is in IT, had then to make an unscheduled journey away from his work to see if he could assist. He received exactly the same instructions I had received and spent a similar amount on the line to an advisor despite telling this advisor that we had been through all this previously. I have copied below the email he sent to Vodafone on Thursday 17th April that explains his frustrations:""Please find attached photos as requested.¬† We've also attached a copy of the syslog from the router, which suggests that the route date and time are incorrect, set to 2023.I'm very angry that this issue is still ongoing, and its been almost a week now and the support we've got has been very poor and disappointing, you seem hung up on us providing photos although to me it's clear the issue isn't on our side or with the OpenReach connectivity!  You keep on insisting that we provide you photos of the light status, although my mother (over 75) spent over an hour on a video call on both Monday and Wednesday and had to move furniture so she could show you the lights on the router and OpenReach portal and we've told you the status of these lights several times, and you even took screenshots of them whilst on the calls.  The issue is clearly not on our side, the OpenReach connectivity was working prior to the change over, the lights (as we keep informing you) are displaying that connectivity is working and the cabling is set correctly up.   The fact you've seen the status of the lights and we've demonstrated and told you their status, I don't understand why this isn't good enough for you and why you've not been taking the issue seriously.  My mother and father are both vulnerable people, and need their phone/internet so they're in contact with their doctors and the hospital, as my dad has needed a pre-op this week and an operation scheduled for next week, so needs to be in daily contact with his doctors and hospital and this has not been possible since Monday. We have attempted to send the photos on several occasions but we were provided the wrong email address, hbbexperts, rather than hbbxperts and even after we confirmed it on the support calls we had nobody on your side spotted the fact that the ""E"" wasn't required or emphasised that the ""E"" wasn't necessary.  The only way we identified the issue was when a text message was sent to my mother with the correct email address in it.  Can I suggest that you set up an additional email address so  that emails sent to hbbexperts are forwarded to hbbxperts, as this would seem a simple way to resolve this understandable confusion and/or send a confirmation text message with the email address clearly provided in it. The fact that you've left two elderly vulnerable people with out access to a phone/internet isn't good enough and after almost a week you've still haven't identified the fault or made any progress in resolving this, I think that this needs to be prioritised and resolved as a matter of urgency! ""He was instructed to go buy a new LAN cable, despite the fact that we had already tried the supplied cable and a spare cable. Needless to say the new cable made no difference. From this you would think that your advisors would surmise that the issue was not the cable having tried three separate cables, including two band new ones. But the next communication is to tell my parents you have dispatched a new cable! As Albert Einstein said ‚ÄúInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results‚ÄùTHIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, ELDERLY VUNERABLE PEOPLE LEFT WITHOUT PHONE OR BROADBAND FOR AT OVER A WEEK WITH NO HELP AND MASSIVE INCONVIENCE AND ADDITIONAL COST!",Member,GB,2025-04-18T21:30:41.000Z

First the sim was 35 pounds which seemed very high but as the retail outlet was the closest to my hotel I bought it.  Now my problems began.  I couldn't text to some of my contacts and the signal would dropout consistently which would stop me from accessing the web or Google Maps (which is essential to any visitor).  Call the help line was very ineffective.  No resolution whatsoever.  So I received a reply from Vodafone.  Their answer was ""do you want to make this an offical review?"" and if you want to talk more about it contact them on X.

1,"I‚Äôve used Vodafone for at least 10 years, the broadband for the last few years but tbh my recent experience has put me off them to the point of when everything I have contract wise ends I will probably be leaving them, it‚Äôs like ¬£150 a month minimum they will loose.I moved my partners number and took a contract out with Vodafone it‚Äôs been horrific. Msgs of data usage been used up, resetting the sim four or five times to try fix it‚Ä¶ basically since February it must close to a month with no phone and it‚Äôs all down to inept technical issues that Vodafone should not be having.So all in all Vodafone are fine till you have an issue then they are totally garbage.How can I recommend anyone to use Vodafone on this principle.

At night, when most people sleep, it's 200-250 Mbps.For what, morons?And I thought Three was crap. I left them for Vodafone.

2,"Spending an hour repeating myself, security questions (interminable), and being asked to confirm via video which lights were on my router (to confirm the same ones I'd already reported, because I am not partially sighted), left me frustrated. Coupled with the call technician being very tricky to understand, and being told on repeat that he was checking if there were other complaints of outages (we kept telling him there were not), he threw the mother of all curve balls in. You must stay on the line, I am trying to get hold of City Fibre. Why must I stay on the line? To keep the ticket open - kept on hold - no! He finally agreed to call me back within 2-3hrs. 2hrs later he kindly called. He was polite.However, he had not managed to contact City Fibre - but he will call me back tomorrow between 4-6pm with an update! This is ridiculous. I have no Internet. I work. I need the Internet specifically for a role I do, which will not hold up to a Hotspot. He told me not to worry, I would receive a token compensatory sum once I have been without Internet for 48hrs. Umm, but I can't do my job tomorrow Vodafone, and will be out of pocket. We evidently need an Engineer, and not another round of pointless phone calls telling me you can't get hold City Fibre. We have also persistently not had the minimum guaranteed speeds over the past 6wks we've been with them. So, no, I would NOT recommend Vodafone. Indeed I would avoid like the plague! And before I receive the rote response of 'do contact our customer service,' no need. I will be raising a formal complaint and will need to find a more reliable, and dependable service provider.",Robin Wilding,GB,2025-04-17T20:55:55.000Z

1,"I switched my Broadband to Vodaphone, what a mistake, take this as a word of warning!!I rang the company as the B/B wouldn't even reach my son's bedroom at the top of the stairs.....I was told to upgrade further or tough luck? The speeds weren't great, so I decided to cancel within my 14 day cooling off period, this is where the problems really started. If you fancy spending hours on the phone, explaining the same problems over and over again to a call-centre in a far away galaxy, then this is the company for you. Not only that, they will throw in talking over the top of you and being what I construe as rudeness....The cherry on the top, was when they left me for over a week with no broadband, delighted I was, with a Daughter at University and Son revising for GCSE's....this one switch thing worked well.I wouldn't mind so much if I hadn't been constantly lied to and reassured that I wouldn't be cut off, but hey-ho, you live and learn....and I've learned that I will never deal with such a bunch of incompetent buffoons, ever again. If you want the ""Vodaphone Experience"" sign on the dotted line, it's an emotional rollercoster, of which you will want to get off, sharpish....Be warned good people. Ps.

1,Vodafone decide when your direct debit will come out and don't care if it does not suit you. On trying to have it changed to the 1st or start of the month I was told the system generates the payment date and it can't be changed to the start. After emailing in a complaint/feedback about this they phoned me multiple times when I was at work despite me asking them to email. They then closed the complaint due to no response from me. Everything is to suit Vodafone and the customer comes last.,Kerry Shaw,GB,2025-04-17T17:12:33.000Z

They are in Breach and I have a Right To Leave as they are not providing the service they are billing me for. I have made Ofcom complaint.1 other niggle - when you try to sign in via phone they send you SMS code but when you return to vodafone screen it has reverted to previous screen so new code, new screen, new code new screen.

However, it took 35 minutes on their live chat, with multiple attempts at upsell while the agent 'looked into it for me'. Crazy. Left such a bad taste.

2,"Vodafone Broadband - Switch from BT.  Was reluctant to switch provider but the savings were significant.  Was given a great deal of reassurance that the switchover would be smooth and there would be no difference.  This is true with regards to the broadband but not true with regards to digital voice/VOIP. BT Digital Voice comes with a 'Digital Voice Adapter' which enables a landline phone base to be in a new location away from the router, in our case the base has the voicemail function to playback etc so has to be accessible.  After a call with Vodafone I have been told that they do not supply a similar product and on further research certain access keys have to be requested from Vodafone and then other equipment configured for access.  Way beyond me and I would think most people. In Summary Broadband great, Digital Voice in our case not a comparable service and will look to see if we can revert back to BT.",p waller,GB,2025-04-17T13:19:21.000Z

Very frustrating automated assistant and very very long pauses between responses when you do get through to an agent. At one point I had to wait over 20 minutes while the agent waited for one of their systems to load.Edit after Vodafone replied: what a pointless reply. My problem is specifically with how bad their support / customer service is (and the fault) and their advice is ... to do the thing I've done twice already that's led to this frustration. Vodafone honestly don't bother with replies like this, they add nothing and just show you're copy and pasting answers without addressing the real issue! Also your live chat has been broken all morning. Or maybe that's just when you select the cancel option.",Duncan M,GB,2025-04-17T11:36:26.000Z

Took 45 mins putting exchange through, my parking was for 1 hour so I told him I need to go if not done right now. They said they can‚Äôt just rush it through, said that‚Äôs fine il pay for another hour and come back. Came back, new lad Marc still struggling, Isaac took over‚Ä¶ another 40mins in total to finalise. As it‚Äôs a trade in for some reason his system can‚Äôt send me the free post and will have to go back in store again and pay for parking! I asked for a free screen protector for the inconvenience 1 hour 25 mins and ¬£8 worth of parking, wasn‚Äôt a lot to ask for said he can‚Äôt do it as they are franchise.

1,"Update on my previous review on Vodafone on 9 April 2025, I have since provided Vodafone with solid evidence from my bank re. the live direct debit and last payment taken from my account on 3 March 2025. But Vodafone refuses to accept that they have ever received the payment because they can't locate it their end! They further refuse to compensate me for the harm and significant inconvenience they have been causing me. Terrible service and experience with Vodafone. We will not touch Vodafone after this contract.",customer,GB,2025-04-15T16:30:34.000Z

1,Viloshin Govinder was superb on the phone.  He was clear and patient and helpful.  He really understood our issues and was a pleasure to deal with.  It is very rare that someone who calls about a service is so helpful and enjoyable to engage with.  However the day for installation came and a) no engineer to do the change - just a box in the post.  And no booster - we were told we would get booster for large house and now after 3 hrs on phone trying to sort this out I hear that the package we were sold does not come with boosters so I have to get some or return everything.  I am BEYOND disappointed and have been misold and now need to investigate what to do about this.,Ms lou burrows,GB,2025-04-29T15:53:23.000Z

I visited again today with the issue still not resolved and no one on the phone or online chat was helpful and no one could diagnose the issue. Rob sat with me today for over an hour to fix the issue. I have now restarted my phone after only leaving a few hours ago and it is working. Rob was incredibly friendly, chatty and polite and was a pleasure to talk to. His colleague was also super helpful and friendly however I didn‚Äôt catch his name.

She has ran out of data on the old phone and needs data for the following day. Late deliveries happen, so I rang Vodaphone to ask for me to pay (not them) for additional data. They told me that I could not do this!!! I cannot pay Vodaphone for services extra due to their delay. Needless to say I cancelled the phone and they didnt care less.

1,"1 star because I have to rate for a review. If it could be zero, it would have been. Thought I'd open a contract with Vodafone broadband because of the reasonable pricing. DON'T BE DRAWN IN. The broadband was installed, didn't work. After an hour on the phone, they'd diagnosed a fault with a cable. They sent a new cable a week later, which was never received. Then they informed me there was a fault in my area. I decided to cancel the contract, which was accepted, and they promised not to charge me. Guess what...they charged me. After an enquiry on my bill, I was first disconnected from the call. Called them back and was told, after two hours that I have to wait for my next bill to be reimbursed. I have literally been charged for a delivery of equipment that didn't work. Also charged for something I didn't receive. Don't be fooled by Vodafone.",mattk,GB,2025-04-14T15:57:16.000Z

1,"Several months ago, after having had lousy service from Virgin I decided to try vodafone, more expensive but I thought it would be better and a bit faster.A few weeks after signing up I had a visit from a vodafone surveyor who informed me that the openreach fibre didn't come to my house so they would have to investigate if and when it would be available.So I contacted openreach who told me that the full fibre was available at my home, so someone from either vodafone or openreach isn't telling the truth.I then heard nothing for a while but finally got a message saying things were going ok.Today I got a text giving me a phone number - 08080034515 - but when I rang it I was told that I would have to use their online chat at vodafone.co.uk.chatonline - but this website either doesn't exist or can't be reached as it timed out using 3 separate browsers.I then tried their website that tells you to use a chatbot called 'tobi' - which is probably short for totally obsolete and incompetent bot.I then rang them and after going through security I had to wait - after about 10 minutes of silence I terminated the call.They then called me back and I had to go through security yet again, only to be told that there are 'delays' getting a service too my home. They could have sent a text or an email or just told me without all the security and waiting.So I've cancelled the installation, Virgin might be bad but at least they can communicate without wasting an hour of my life.BT broadband using full fibre from openreach is used by several people just a few yards from my home and BT and EE have also confirmed that full fibre is available at my home right now with speeds up to 1.6Gbps so vodafone are talking total rubbish.UPDATE - about an hour after writing this I went outside and there 50 yards down the road was an Openreach team with their manhole open - so I asked them if the fibre went to the end of the road where I live on my side of the road and they confirmed that it does.So thanks Vodafone, I've found out just how incompetent you are without having to use your services for a few years!UPDATE 2 - the links you send to 'speak to your team' - the first one is to your pathetic chatbot Tobi and the second doesn't link to anything except your FB page - AAND THERE IS NO WAY TO INITIATE A CHAT ON IT.DO YOU ACTUALLY CHECK THAT LINKS WORK BEFORE YOU WRITE THIS DRIVEL?UPDATE. 21/05/2025. I checked with EE, BT and the openreach engineer who was feeding fiber to my neighbours home, they all confirmed that there was fiber to the road outside my home. HOWEVER - yesterday I had two workmen from Openreach knocked on my door to inform me that they were there to install the pipework for the fiber - when I said I thought it was already in place I was told it stopped about 30 yards before my property, they then dug up  the pavement and installed it.So I owe you and your surveyor an apology.",doug,GB,2025-05-21T11:34:08.000Z

It wasn't just the fact he got me back up and running, it was his warmth, caring attitude and his total grasp of the severity of the situation for me that blew me away. Haz treated me with such respect and made me feel valued, his service was way and beyond all my expectations, he really went the extra mile for me.

1,I have broadband with these puppets. Had broadband for awhile were I suppose to have pro2 fibre 900 which for over 10 months nothing but trouble and speeds only around between 254mbps and then still dropping at that and this is on Ethernet not WiFi. I have spoken to at least 64 people regarding this and everyone has done the same disconnect from mains do a speed test everything and even sent photos to them but they still will not fix. They keep saying we are providing u the speed so I ask prove this just like I gave to your via photos and even live links were they have looked in my property and seen this but they say we not in a position to show u yes because u are liars. Now I have told them u need get me out of this contract as not accepting no more it‚Äôs not fair paying for this and not getting the service and all they can do is say we will send u to court if u stop u payments with us.i think u r out of order and need get me out of this contract so i can go elsewhere and I mean free of charge as well. Look u need to look elsewhere whoever sees this has u will get lied too and trust me I have been for ages and they will not sort it just lie and say we r giving u speed when u no they not and can prove this. Stay completely away from these they are scammers when it comes to broadband. I have been in touch and all you have done is not helped . U need to get me out of my contract and let me go elsewhere because all you have done is caused my mental health to go through the roof and it‚Äôs causing me to be ill. Stop with contact us I have just look into my account for this name u will see. Like I say I am not bothered I have stopped my payments take me to court but be careful because I have evidence u wouldn‚Äôt believe,Lee Pitts,GB,2025-04-13T15:14:58.000Z

1,"Utterly useless support. Constant issues getting my broadband set up, with them constantly not understanding what I'm asking and failing to do tasks as required so that future issues are prevented. They've failed to input dates properly, constantly failed to miss deadlines or even communicate within this business so that orders are completed. Combine this with a heap of hurdles using both their chat line and phone support leaving me constantly having to repeat information to new support agents or even the chat bot asking for the same piece of information multiple times because it has no grasp of context or memory meaning this is the worst experience I've ever had with a company",Matt,GB,2025-04-13T14:05:15.000Z

1,"Update (25th March 2025): Vodafone‚Äôs latest ‚Äúsolution‚Äù was directing me to a broken VOXI link (-----) after 20 days of zero connectivity. They still demand ¬£96 to cancel their unusable service.  Key Failures:  1. False Advertising: Coverage checker claimed ‚Äúfull 4G/5G‚Äù at my address ‚Äì proven lies.  2. Support Farce: 15+ agents repeated ‚Äúreset APN/SIM swap‚Äù like broken robots.  3. Financial Blackmail: ¬£96 fee to escape their scam.  Critical Ask to Trustpilot Users:  - Have you faced similar issues? How did you resolve them?  - Should I sue? Vodafone‚Äôs lies breach the Consumer Rights Act 2015 ‚Äì is court my only option?  - Screenshot Shame: Trustpilot won‚Äôt let me upload chat proofs, but imagine agents pasting scripts like NPCs while ignoring logic.  To Vodafone:  This is your final public warning. Resolve this by:  1. Waiving the ¬£96 fee.  2. Compensating 20 days of lost service + distress.  3. Fixing your fraudulent coverage checker.  Final Plea: If you value your time, money, or sanity, AVOID VODAFONE. To fellow victims:How do we unite against this predatory company?",Nazeer,GB,2025-04-13T12:35:41.000Z

1,"I currently do not have a broadband socket on my wall‚Äîonly a loose, hanging cable. I initially raised the issue with my service provider, Vodafone, and they escalated it through Openreach under ticket number FLT12833411.An Openreach engineer was dispatched, but instead of resolving the issue, he cut the cable and made things worse. He discovered that the cable was faulty and the connection was unstable. He confirmed that the job would require digging and a full cable replacement. As a temporary fix, he created a makeshift connection just so I could have some level of internet, as all my essential home systems (heating, security cameras, lights, etc.) rely on internet connectivity.Unfortunately, around this time, my billing cycle with Vodafone came up. Instead of resolving the issue, Vodafone closed the ticket prematurely, which halted all progress. Since Openreach cannot proceed without an active ticket, I was advised by their engineer to open a new one through Vodafone. After spending more than 4 weeks on first ticket, I did so, and the new ticket number is FLT2893893.It has now been nearly three weeks since the second ticket was raised, and nothing has been done. Vodafone continues to bounce the responsibility around between different teams, while Openreach appears to be unsure of how to proceed.To make matters worse, Vodafone and Openreach have both attempted to shift responsibility to each other, resulting in zero progress and ongoing frustration.In summary, I strongly advise against signing any contract with Vodafone. Their customer service has been disorganized and unprofessional, and their coordination with Openreach has been ineffective and disappointing.",Shahab Aslani,GB,2025-04-13T11:37:09.000Z

1,"We took out Vodafone broadband 2 years ago, when this was installed the guy who ran the cable to the house tacked it to the fence and assured a different team would be out to dig the cable in the ground. 2 years on the cable is still (barely) tacked to the fence which is now becoming dangerous and a trip hazard, occasionally spilling out on the public pathway if I don‚Äôt tack it back. Phoned Vodafone countless times and they say it‚Äôs down to open reach. Openreach then come out look at it, sit in the van for half hour then disappear without sorting the problem. Rinse. Repeat. With absolutely no way of contacting openreach I have to keep going back to Vodafone and nothing seems to be getting resolved.",Connor Dollimore,GB,2025-04-13T10:01:21.000Z

1,"I‚Äôve been with Vodafone for over 2 years now and the connectivity is not the best. Maybe I‚Äôm just always in the 1% area that isn‚Äôt covered‚Ä¶Anyway, I recently saw they had an offer that has a greater data limit than mine while costing almost half the price so I thought I could call and check if they are able to switch me to that as when I got on the contract I am currently on I kept asking for the cheapest one. However, they said that I can‚Äôt do that because I‚Äôve signed another contract with them and it‚Äôs past the 14days cooldown period so I‚Äôd have to pay for the remaining time on my contract if I wanted to get a new one. Lesson learned that I shouldn‚Äôt be having a multi year contract with any provider. VOXI seems a much better choice as it uses the same Vodafone network and has no contract monthly pricing that‚Äôs a lot cheaper than Vodafone itself.",Aaron,GB,2025-04-13T09:36:09.000Z

They will not let me cancel despite the fact it's going to be 2 months with no Broadband. How can it be right that I have to continue to pay for a service that's not being provided? Thank you for your totally pointless reply. Have tried those phone numbers on multiple occasions and everytime have left with zero resolution. Can't connect to your Facebook either. TBH seems you don't want to help resolve just reply with cheap words that have zero affect with my situation. 2 months with no Broadband but paying your useless company for the privilege.

1,"Vodafone uses ""Service Level Agreement (SLA)"" timelines, rather than responding to urgent need to be in touch with my wife and daughter, and give them access to emergency calls if required.  I have spent over 20 hours now on trying to get them connected, with very little help (or apparently concern) from VodafoneWHERE:  Mexico (off-grid with no connection to telephone service, despite 3-4 bars and recent historical telco access (on previous trips).WHEN: 7 days and countingWHAT:  Immediately upon landing in Mexico, my wife called me on the airport Wifi and let me know that there was no service.VODAFONE's RESPONSE:  IMMEDIATELY, I spent HOURS on the phone trouble-shooting with them (every possible remedy - including trying ESIM, resetting everything, taking off spending cap, setting up data roaming, etc. etc. etc.).  REQUEST TO ESCALATE:  DENIED by Vodafone;  Clearly it was not a fault with my wife or daugher's phone, but Vodafone wouldn't escalte.  I spent Most of Saturday and Sunday speaking with various agents trying to get them connected.QUOTES:  ""We have 14 days in which to respond.""  I said that it was unconscionable that they would rely on an SLA of 14 days, rather than escalte and try to get my wife and daughter access to being able to call me or local emergency services if they were worried at allCOMPLAINT:   I Logged a COMPLAINT:  Response was the SLA again:  ""we have 7 days in which to repond.""  You've got to be kidding me!ESCALATION:  FINALLY, on Monday (4 days later), I was told that it was escalated to ""engineers,"" and they wanted ""screen shots"" of the error messages.  I had them pre-prerared and replied within 2 minutes not only multiple screens, but also with a full list of trouble-shooting steps taken, and texts from Vodafone of instructions, which we/they had followed.  Apparently, this was with ""LEVEL 3"" tech support (very high - ha!)24 HOURS LATER:  I received a note from the Engineers asking for screenshots of the error messages? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  I had already sent this, and now sent back at least a dozen.COMPLAINT:  I complained again, and waited on the phone.  In speaking with ""Sally"" I was told that I was at the highest level of customer service.  I asked for when I would hear back and she said that ""there are many other people.... bla bla..."" and she ""might be in touch within 24 hours.""  I couldn't understand how it would take another 24 hours to investigate something which had been ongoing for 5 days and was with top level engineers.  Surely, if ANYONE prioritised it, she could find out immediately.  FINALLY, she PROMISED TO CALL ME BACK IN 1 Hour.- 5 HOURS LATER!  I received a call back from ""Josh,"" who said that he was the highest level of support (wait a minute...?), above Sally.  Ok... When will you promise to call me back (this was around noon).  He wanted to say 24 hours, finally agreed ""before he left the office,"" which would have been the end of the day, and not allow any time for anyone to investigate.  FINALLY, he promised to call me at 4pm, which he did, said that it was being investigated still, but seemed to be moving, but .... ""HE WAS TAKING TOMORROW OFF,"" and would hand over to someone else who would call me.  They didn't, but I did receive an email that said that my wife's phone was connected, but if there were problems to please send MORE SCREENSHOTS.  IT WAS NOT, so I sent even more screenshots.  I had been able to be in touch with my wife and daughter occasionaly, but not while they were home only when they travelled out to a local restaurant and got onto WiFi.I FINALLY received a call when I was in the midst of a meeting, but took it informed them that they were STILL NOT CONNECTED, that I had sent screenshots, and owuld he please email me.1 FULL WEEK LATER:  Still no mobile access.  no Follow up from Josh, who is back at work, and upon calling the ""escalation line,"" spoke with someone who quoted SLA's again and said that they might respond in 24-48 hours.ARE YOU KIDDING ME?This is so shocking that it's beyond comprehension.  If someone were to happen to my wife and daughter, and they could have avoived it by calling for emergency or calling me and having me call others who I know in the area and emergency services, I can just imagine the HEADLINES:  VODAFONE RELIES ON SLAs, rather than tries to do the human and humane thing and try help a young girl and her mother off the grid in MEXICO.UNCONSCIONABLE, CARELESS, and SHOCKING",EAW,GB,2025-04-11T19:54:06.000Z

1,"THAT'S IT...we gave this telephone provider one last chance. After ALMOST NINE WEEKS we are still no further forward in having fibre optic broadband installed in out home, despite it being within 20 ft of our property. Excuse after excuse drove us round the bend - so we've had enough of lies and inefficiency on a grand scale. We have spent countless hours on the phone to them and all we got were false promises and prevarication.With all the modern technology around the service just gets worse.Asking our advice?

1,"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed and frustrated with the experience I‚Äôve had. I originally had broadband with this company, but the service was poor ‚Äî constant buffering and lag made it unusable. When I contacted them about it, I was advised to upgrade, with the promise that it would improve the connection and that I would receive additional equipment to boost the signal in another room.Despite the upgrade, the issues continued. Buffering persisted, and the network performance remained unreliable. After nearly a year of this, I made the decision to disconnect the service and switch to a different provider.What‚Äôs worse, they failed to send me a final bill, yet reported me to credit agencies claiming I owed them money ‚Äî which negatively impacted my credit score. When I called to resolve the matter, I was met with dishonesty and blatant misinformation.Absolutely unacceptable. Disgraceful service ‚Äî avoid at all costs.",Marta,GB,2025-04-11T11:33:36.000Z

1,"Took advantage of an upgrade in Vodafone Store 2.4.25 on home phone & Broadband.Deal was to bring my mobile across to Vodafone ¬£5.00 a month which was done in 24 hours. Numerous emails were received regarding the home phone & broadband upgrade. One email stated Vodafone will advise you when upgrade is completed. To complete the upgrade, you need to switch off the router and switch it back on. After the upgrade the cost would be reduced from ¬£28.00 to ¬£26.00 a month for 2-year contract. Visted 3 Vodafone stores as no email were received and each one was helpful. All confirmed that once upgrade was completed my price will be ¬£26.00. Last store confirmed that upgrade was completed on 3.4.2025. Sent Vodafone an email asking them to confirm upgrade completed and home phone & broadband package is now ¬£26.00 a month for 2 years contract that me the customer signed for. Response was sorry you are unhappy with the process. Within their process to notify me of the upgrade completion which they hadn‚Äôt. After 3 emails later 10th April received confirmation upgrade completed. But now my package is a total ¬£34.52 (Mobile ¬£5.00 home phone & broadband ¬£29.52). Three stores confirm this would be ¬£26.00 yet the specialist team state ¬£29.52 same legally binding 2-year contract. Instead of saving money its now costing me more. Vodafone response is I need to call them to get something that I signed a contract for ¬£26.Visited another branch nearly an hour with two staff who found the issue Additional Discount of ¬£2.00 had not been applied thanks to them.  Specialist care team have been advised as well as i have emailed them.Emailed them three times asking for confirmation of the ¬£26 just ignored my emails. Customer has to spend time doing the job of a paid member of staff",james,GB,2025-04-12T04:15:14.000Z

He was patient, he listened and he worked hard to get things right for us.   He has been polite all the way through the process and shown is professionalism and respect throughout.

1,"I signed up with their broadband service just before Christmas last year. When it was time for the wifi to go active, there was no connection. I waited a few days and nothing changed. So I called and they sent out an engineer. After, still nothing. I called up and canceled and was told that they would send me a box to return the hub. They then charged me at the end of the month which I questioned and they said that I would receive the money back once the hub was returned. A month later and they still hadn't sent me the box for the return. Called up again and had to literally drive to the store to return the hub. Another month passes and still no refund, so I called again and then they said I would have to wait another month to receive my money. I waited that time for them to only refund me half of my money. Still haven't been refunded for the rest. Please avoid going with vodafone unless you want to be scammed out of time and money. I would have left a 0 star review if I could.",clhadley,GB,2025-04-10T09:27:06.000Z

I was also told the signal in my road was very good and that‚Äôs why I transferred to Vodafone, but it‚Äôs not that good I‚Äôm afraid.

2,"Just joined about a month ago after 6yrs with Virgin so just like everyone else I needed a first time new fibre cable connected to my property from the telegraph pole in the street. Everything went smoothly enough, except the Openreach installer turning up an hour earlier than the time window I was given (I was in bed) and I never even received an apology although standard of work was very good.The white Power Hub modem (not faulty) is so cheap and nasty and struggles to connect to devices in the next room through a single skin breeze block wall! I‚Äôm not able to get a free Wi-Fi booster from them because I‚Äôm not on an eligible plan so I now have to pay to buy one. The reason I switched, just like others was so it is cheaper. When I factor in the purchase of the booster and the extra electricity this will use, collectively over the course of the contract compared to older provider, I‚Äôm now financially worse off and I can‚Äôt go back for two years! Crazy!!! Another negative - collectively now I will have a third socket permanently taken up in the house compared to just one for my old Virgin modem that worked perfect and had Wi-Fi that reached all over the house! They even have a Wi-Fi full house guarantee and give all customers free boosters if they have a problem.And one more thing - WHY WHY WHY do Vodafone send so much communication?????As I‚Äôd previously said, there has not really been any issues but since signing up, upto now I have received a total of 11 emails and 22 text message!! WHY? I am autistic and am easily overwhelmed so thanks for hitting that tipping point multiple times with unnecessary communications.Oh and them numbers - that does not include communication from Virgin who I left.These companies need to do a lot better!",Pete Cody,GB,2025-04-09T15:44:12.000Z

2,"Price increases should be linked to performance. Living in a rural area the signal is, at best, shaky. Why should I pay more with such an unreliable service? Should Vodafone provide discounted rates for poor service coverage?Vodafone have responded in many, many words but in summary `we are trying harder` but did not answer the question.So lets try- why do I pay the same price as someone in a city who gets a better service than I do as a rural user?",Nigel C,GB,2025-04-10T11:50:08.000Z

Days later they made an error on the order they had to recall me and set it up (these things happen) however now engineer can only get here 2 weeks from now. Frustrating but whatever. On the day he's meant to come. I call Vodaphone and they have no idea about any engineer visit. I was told this company was one of the best that's why I went for it. They have no idea what they're doing and doing communicate with each other. Very poor experience. Waiting on a call back, if they push back my date again I'm cancelling.",Alex,GB,2025-04-09T09:38:51.000Z

1,"After telling Vodafone to ""Cancel"" my order after nothing but lies and stress and total lack of customer service, I was told......I was unable to cancel. I informed Vodafone that I have NO service in my property because Vodafone was ""In breach of their contract to me"" and therefore I'm in my right to cancel. I asked if I could have a ""prepaid"" label so that I could return their ""Internet Modem"" only to be told.....""We don't do that""but......""You can return it back to any Vodafone store"", Which I did only to receive through the post 2 day's later a pre post label. Vodafone staff don't know what their doing, constant lies!!! *Since my last post, I did receive a response (On here from Vodafone) but, when you ring the number provided.....yet again you are passed from Department to Department and put on hold constantly!

In store I found the ideal phone, Sam transferred all the data across seamlessly, and also I now pay less per month than I was previously. Additionally Samsung are currently running a promotion regarding free ear-pods and fit-bit. Uploading receipts, personal details, IMEI numbers to the Samsung site proved too much for me - Sam did it all and I am now awaiting promotional gift. So helpful.",David,GB,2025-04-08T21:17:47.000Z

A woman with a foreign accent asked for my card details (including security number at the back) and I foolishly gave her them and told her the amount I wished to top up. It was only after I hung up that I realised what I had done. The top up went through, so it was indeed Vodafone. I then had to go to the trouble of cancelling my card. They should not be asking sensitive information like this! It's ILLEGAL.",Anon,GB,2025-04-08T21:13:31.000Z

1,"As a new resident from Hong Kong, I recently purchased a cellphone from Vodafone and was persuaded to take out their insurance policy, which had a minimum term of three months. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that AppleCare offered the same coverage for just ¬£7 a month on a two-year contract. Unfortunately, due to Vodafone's misleading information, I missed the 60-day window to purchase AppleCare directly from Apple.When I contacted Vodafone to cancel the insurance after the three-month period, I even offered to pay for the entire three months upfront. However, they refused to terminate the policy immediately, citing ridiculous system limitations. This is utterly unacceptable. I should not be forced to pay for a service I no longer want or need.To make matters worse, the staff at Vodafone misled me. As a first-time buyer from a network provider, I was never informed that I could still purchase AppleCare even if the phone was bought elsewhere. This entire experience has been incredibly frustrating and disappointing.Due to this appalling treatment, I will be switching my four phone numbers and broadband service to another provider as soon as my contract ends. I strongly urge others to consider alternatives to Vodafone to avoid similar headaches.",Kewl Mat,GB,2025-04-08T11:08:29.000Z

They up sale there products which on there own website is cheaper. They hang up the phone on you, they scam you taking your bank details which they already have on the system, don't give them any banking information. Totally the worst network you can possibly be with. Just on an average day you need to clear your schedule for the day to be on the phone to them as they will get it wrong many times. Even if you ask them to repeat the order for you they still send you a wrong device",rogert berisha,GB,2025-04-07T20:10:01.000Z

1,"So I've had a response to my original review and was asked to contact Vodafone using Facebook, Live chat or a phone number.Live chat wasn't available, Facebook is not any use for me for this issue and the number to call was the same useless number as before where I'd end up speaking to someone thousands of miles away...The reason for my call is that I did not get a satisfactory solution to my original issue plus I wish to cancel my mobile WiFi as it doesn't work at my new address.I've spent too many wasted hours on the phone trying to get a customer service employee to understand what I'd like so I'll continue to criticise this totally useless company until I achieve a positive outcome...I've been on contract with these for over 10 years and was PAYG for many years previously..How they have performed is totally disgraceful.",Martin,GB,2025-04-07T17:03:28.000Z

1,"I am writing this reviw to express my frustration regarding an ongoing issue with my account. Despite making my payment, my internet has been restricted because my account did not initially show the payment. I have spent all morning trying to resolve this issue, as I work from home, and my internet is still not functioning.I have spoken to three different agents, each of whom reassured me that the restriction bar had been lifted. However, I find it difficult to understand why this needs to be done by each agent, especially when honesty should be a key part of customer service. If the bar has already been lifted, why does every agent claim to need to do it again?This has led to poor communication and a lack of service, which is disappointing, especially given that I have been a loyal Vodafone customer for years. However, based on this experience, I will not be renewing my contract.I would greatly appreciate it if a manager or team leader could look into this issue and provide a resolution as soon as possible.",Nikki,GB,2025-04-07T15:14:04.000Z

1,I took out an online deal for Vodafone broadband. They sent an engineer from openreach who said that the Vodafone equipment was faulty and he couldn't complete the job. I spoke to Vodafone who said it was the engineer's fault and he would need to come back but the earliest slot available was in 2 weeks time. They did not seem bothered that my family would be without internet for 2 weeks and that I worked from home. I asked for a manager but was told that he would not be able to help. I had no choice but to cancel the contract and go back to my previous provider.I will never use Vodafone again for anything. Be warned.,Mark,GB,2025-04-07T15:03:05.000Z

Explained clearly contract terms and conditions. She helped me transfer my current iPhone contents to the new one and took my old one in for a trade in (which I was given a good price for). There was a few iPhone bits that took some time, but Jodi did this without me in the shop and I felt comfortable to leave my device. Overall very happy with my experience and shiny new iPhone.

1,"AWFUL! They mess about with your plan whenever they want to for their own gain so your credit is eaten up. Then you end up on their Webchat for over an hour trying to fix it - they don‚Äôt return credit but rather might add some extra data. But, they sneakily try to add it using a different plan to yours so that you stay in the loop of loosing money and needing to spend hours on webchat with them. Webchat is also set up very badly since it closes after 3 minutes of no responding despite the fact that for them to process actions it requires 5 minutes.

1,Left Vodafone because bad service they have taken a month's payment from my account that they should not have because Iam now with Tesco mobile their so called customer care person said I will have to try to get this money back without customer service help. Be warned this called happen to you if you leave them.

1,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ordered broadband and a phone sim only to realise the next day they had put down the wrong address. Phoned up to correct this and they said they couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúbecause the system puts that address in automatically from my postcode‚Äù customer service was awful being moved from person to person without an answer. In the end cancelled the entire order and went with BT. Start of the next month I have been charged ¬£10 despite cancelling the order immediately, called to ask for it back they said they would in a month but that I would only get ¬£9.63 back and not ¬£10, yet to receive this still. They have now delivered a WiFi router (to the wrong address) that I had to go pick-up. Called to ask why this was delivered when I‚Äôve cancelled the order and they said ‚Äúit was cancelled on our end but also wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù which makes no sense. They the asked me to take the router to a Vodafone store to return. Told them I live nowhere near a Vodafone store so would have to drive 35 mins and pay for parking to do so, which I won‚Äôt be doing. They are now sending me a returns label to send it back. Beyond awful customer service, will never use Vodafone again and have warned others also. Since have found others with the same awful experience. Pitiful company.",D J,GB,2025-04-05T14:11:52.000Z

1,"****PLEASE PLEASE AVOID VODAFONE FOR BROADBAND SERVICE****I moved my Home Broadband to Vodafone from SKY, biggest mistake i did.Even 1*  rating is more.I have worst broadband experience in last 12 yearsWe have highest 900 Mbps Vodafone broadband at home.Within 2 nd month of switching Vodafone, Internet outage started, it happend 3 times in 2 conseative weeks (more than 24 hrs).Internet outage so frequent, we did not had any Internet for more than 48 hrs.Even though my repeated request to Vodafone customer care issue was not sorted.Yesterday Internet outage was more than 24 hrs, Vodafone customer care promised that it will get sorted out within 24 hrs and booked Cityfibre Engineer to sort it out.I waited from morning 8-12 PM no show from Vodafone/Cityfibre Engineer, customer care person informed later that Engineer visit is rescheduled between 1PM to 5PM , again no Show.Vodafone customer care person called around 3PM to inform that it again Engineer visit is reschedule to next day.Horrible and Pathetic Customer care.Since I work from home lost 2 days billing.I immediately called other Broadband Services provider to switch.Even though switch new service provider is expensive but I had no choice left.I would recommend everyone who are planning to Switch to Vodafone think twice before switching.

The system tells me that it can‚Äôt let me in because I don‚Äôt have an active subscription or they haven‚Äôt finished setting it up yet.Seven days later after trying every day. I get through to the customer care team who ask me to sign into my account to confirm my identity. The account I can‚Äôt sign into. They then ask me to enter my phone number. Everything crashes.

1,"Absolutely terrible experience taking out a new contract. Although initially everything seemed to work, none of Vodafone's systems detected my number as being one of theirs. Collectively I've spent 3 hours speaking to customer services agents trying to resolve this. Eventually I was told that my number needed to be 'cleansed'. I agreed to this and spent 24 hours with my number disconnected. After this it seemed things were finally fixed. Now a new set of problems where my contract has been restarted with half the data and ¬£10 a month more expensive! Already spoken to one customer service representative that couldn't see the issue. Speaking to another now. This is wasting so much of my time. I wish I'd have stayed on my old network and never taken out this contract.",Daniel Walker,GB,2025-04-04T18:38:29.000Z

1,"I joined Vodafone broadband and there was a promotional offer for ¬£75 bill credit, you would think this would be automatically applied? No.Ive chased this up 3 times, today I used Tobi chat, after i was transferred to an agent, i was getting unrelated messages sent to the point I was confused whether i had actually been transferred to an agent, anyways back to the credit, the 2nd time I called in Feb, I received a text confirming that adter 60 days of activation, i would receive the credit, I didn't, which is why I had to chase again today. 1st agent from billing said she would transfer to home broadband and that i wouldn't have to repeat myself, I did. The 2nd agent was useless and started saying that the text mesnt 60 days after my loss of service was resolved, which I then had to explain again, that it was not due to loss of service but a promotional offer for switching to Vodafone, to which the agent replied that it would be applied in my next bill, but my Vodafone app doesnt show that so I asked for proof, the agent said, ill pass you over to our billing team (AGAIN!!!!), Now the 3rd agent, made me confirm everything again, who now also tried to sell a sim! Not interested. The 3rd agent gave me a link and said I should fill in a form and wait 14 days, are you kidding, I asked for it to be resolved now as i didn't want to wait again, to my surprise NOT, the 3rd agent says, im sorry, i am from the customer care team, i would need to transfer you to the dedicated team, I said I didn't want to be transferred for the 4th time but the agent says that they cant help further, so here I am waiting on the 4th agent, Absolutely ridiculous customer experience Update: still on the chat 2 hrs later, 5th agent said im not eligible, 6th agent was a little more helpful, i noted everything down from my interactions, so i know the date which the agent confirmed on the phone that i was eligible, asked them to listen to the calls, 6th agent has raised a form to another team and said i have to sait 48hrs, so still no proper resolution after 2.5hrs",Yusuf Khan,GB,2025-04-04T13:16:33.000Z

1,"I have recently had a really poor experience with Vodafone broadband.My contract is Pro Fibre II 910, which sells as up to 910mbps with a guarantee in my contract of at least 455mbps.It's fast but even if I plug directly into my hub, I only get 430mbps at best.  I know this might be picky but I was sold 910 !It worked fairly well until recently but post a recent overnight upgrade it consistently is dropping out. This is what led to me complaining. I can only suggest that as the old cables are becoming defunct that they are pushing more volume through the fibre.Upon discussing with what appears to  be an offshore customer service centre, they quickly shut down my complaint bruskly saying there is no guarantee. (Funny that it states ninimums in my contract.  They can keep to the contract when it comes to annual increases 3.9% above inflation).For a communications company their call centre audio levels are very low and difficult to inderstand.  The call dropped out a few times too.I would not recommend using their broadband and will vote with my feet at renewal",Brian in Rugby,GB,2025-04-04T10:45:20.000Z

1,Not getting the refund after cancelling during cooling-off period. It is nonsense that they charge me the first bill in full (instead of pro rata) when I cancel my Gigacube during the cooling-off period. And now they said I will have to wait for the second billing cycle to have the pro rate refund back. This is ridiculous! I cancelled my plan within 14 days and they take over 30 days to proceed with a termination refund. Never seen any service provider work like this.,S K,GB,2025-04-03T17:05:18.000Z

1,"Absolutely Terrible Service ‚Äì Avoid Vodafone Broadband!I signed up for Vodafone broadband expecting 500Mbps, but I‚Äôm getting a pathetic 260Mbps. To make things worse, the settings don‚Äôt even allow me to force 5GHz-only mode, so I‚Äôm stuck with unreliable connections.Tried reaching out to customer service? What a joke. I wasted hours being bounced from one clueless agent to another. Their grand solution? Reboot the device (which took forever), then tell me to turn off WiFi and reconnect. Nothing worked, and they never actually addressed my questions.Frustrated, I asked to cancel my contract, thinking they‚Äôd at least attempt to fix the issue. Instead, they immediately agreed‚Äîno effort to resolve the problem, no apology, nothing. Just shows how much they care about keeping customers. I literally cancelled my contract within 2 hours from activation.If you‚Äôre thinking about Vodafone broadband‚ÄîDON‚ÄôT. Absolute garbage service with zero customer support.",ayman moslih,GB,2025-04-03T16:46:43.000Z

1,"Changing to Vodafone broadband was a big mistake. Their router won't let me split the bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz). So I lost the use of several devices. It was not explained in any way that I would lose functionality of certain devices that have been working just fine for many years and that they've taken away your ability to simply fix it. I've spent four hours this morning in online chat. Finally was able to enable compatibility mode, and have managed to get the printer working that my partner needs for her business. My Sonos system seems to be a lost cause entirely and I'm at the end of my tether. Why they've shut down the facility to split the bands I don't know. And I'm so angry that they made no mention that many devices will not work with their new router during the sign up process. So angry and disappointed.",Jason Lumley,GB,2025-04-03T14:48:23.000Z

1,"I have been without broadband for eight months due to Vodafone's negligence. Further, they made commitments to provide me with compensation that they will now not honour, and have made no attempt to compensate me for the loss of my landline in this period.I placed an order for full fibre broadband and a landline on 1st August 2024. I advised Vodafone that dig work was required and Vodafone then guaranteed I would be connected by 27th August.I was finally connected eight months later - and all it took was the right team spending about five hours at my property.I ordered a full broadband service with Vodafone on 01/08/24. They guaranteed to connect me on 27/08/24 (which was the earliest date available). They failed to connect me, and guaranteed by email and text message they would pay me ¬£6.10 compensation for each day until my service is up and running. OpenReach severed my existing copper wire which removed all internet to my property.I called them to discuss this - due to having two young children, and adults working from home I explained it was urgent to connect me. Over the course of the last seven months I also received guarantees that the compensation outlined was the minimum compensation I would receive. Vodafone did offer me compensation for the joining incentives I missed out on, although they are refusing to pay these to my bank account.During the seven months my repeated attempts to get Vodafone to connect me has been unsuccessful. OpenReach will not accept any direct contact from me, and will only work with suppliers. The sheer scale of incompetence on display has been staggering including:OpenReach severing my broadband and phone line connectionI had phoned Vodafone prior to 27/08/24 and advised that digging was needed to connect, and Vodafone assured me that OpenReach were fully aware and prepared to connect me on that day - the team then turned up with no prior briefingOpenReach seeking permission from my neighbours to dig on a shared drive located in a different town to fix the problemOpenReach wrongly assuming my repair needed a dig on a shared driveway - which was not neededVodafone repeatedly taking money from my bank account during this periodVodafone has sent numerous engineers who have turned up with no briefing that there is an issue at the property, and each time believed they only had to replace a connected copper wire with a full fibre wireVodafone unilaterally cancelling my order, forcing me to place another orderVodafone sending conflicting contradictory messages on compensation to meVodafone has been entirely reactive and passive in their approach to remedying this issue, failing to in any way manage their suppliersAfter Vodafone waiting for over six months for OpenReach to connect my property to the network, which they completed on 06/03/25, Vodafone were not ready to connect me due to an issue with Vodafone's back office. That is correct, six months was not enough time for Vodafone to ensure their internal systems could provide the service, and they believe they will connect me on 02/04/25.When the correct team arrived at my property, they were able to connect the full fibre cable from my property to the network in less than seven hours. The only digging they did was on a public pavement where no permissions from residents were required.To add insult to injury, Vodafone have repeatedly used the agreement (or code of conduct they signed up to) with the regulator as a limitation on their ability to pay out compensation, and have stated to me on numerous occasions that this agreement prevents them compensation me in line with the commitments they made to me verbally, by email, and by text message. They are seeking to limit their compensation to a maximum of sixty days. This code automatically provides minimum compensation, and assumes proper conduct by suppliers.I have pointed out to Vodafone on many occasions that their legal team have approved the commitments which they make by email and text messages to customers they let down in this way.",Declan Meenan,GB,2025-04-03T11:20:06.000Z

1,"We set up broadband for our new house a few weeks ago which all seemed fine, but the day after we got an email saying the order had been cancelled with no explanation. After being unsuccessful in getting an explanation over the phone, we had to go into a Vodafone store (The Trafford Centre, Manchester) and were told that it was a glitch and that the order was fine and still scheduled for the 3rd and openreach would be in touch sometime before the install date. Well it‚Äôs the 3rd today and we hadn‚Äôt been contacted by them and had no router. Called up customer service and they said the order had in fact been cancelled and then offered to set up a new order with no discount and it would take the same 10-14 days as originally. So now we‚Äôve had 2 weeks wasted and still no WiFi. I‚Äôve previously had issues with transferring phone contracts as well so will be avoiding this company at all costs from now on. Don‚Äôt bother!",Emily,GB,2025-04-03T10:46:57.000Z

1,"If you want to swap your WiFi to Vodafone at the end of your WiFi contract, do it a month or two in advanced!I have been without WiFi since the 14th of march 2025 now and I am still no where near having my new vodafone full fibre installed. My original install date with Vodafone (city fibre) was the 17th of march 2025 and as of today I am still without WiFi. City fibre are coming by to do an asbestos check today but then I have to wait for the results, have another visit for wire planning and then finally the install and activation. They have no regard or care for their customers at all which is very clear when on the phone to them and I haven't even started my WiFi contract with Vodafone yet. I cannot stress enough how much it is probably worth paying more for sky or virgin full fibre instead as this whole process has been horrific and shameful. If I'm lucky I'll have my WiFi installed and activated by the 17th of April 2025, a whole month late.They also do NOT tell you this information in advanced, you get a text message the day before your install date saying it has been ""delayed""!!DO NOT GO WITH CITY FIBRE AND VODAFONE FOR INTERNET!!!",Ethan Starbuck,GB,2025-04-03T10:19:56.000Z

1,"Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Broadband Service and Customer SupportDear Vodafone Customer Service Team,I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the service I have received since signing up for a new broadband deal with Vodafone. While I have been a loyal fan of Vodafone, my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed.One of the key benefits of the broadband package I signed up for included a one-year free subscription to McAfee antivirus. However, I only received six months instead of the full year. When I raised this issue, I was provided with a mere ¬£20 compensation, my daughter received 1gb, which does not adequately address the shortfall in service.Furthermore, throughout my time using Vodafone broadband, I have encountered numerous issues, including inconsistent service quality and poor customer support. Each time I have reached out to resolve my concerns, I have had to deal with unhelpful and argumentative staff. Despite contacting customer service five or six times, I have never received a text message inviting me to provide feedback on my experience. This raises concerns about Vodafone‚Äôs commitment to customer satisfaction and continuous improvement.I expect Vodafone to rectify this situation by:1. Providing me with the remaining six months of McAfee antivirus as originally promised.2. Addressing the poor customer service experience I have endured.3. Ensuring that your feedback system is operational and includes all customers, so experiences like mine can be reported and addressed.I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to my concerns. Should I not receive a satisfactory reply within 14 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate my complaint to the appropriate regulatory bodies.Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and provide a clear timeline for resolution.Yours sincerely,Steven Johnson",George Johnson,GB,2025-04-02T20:29:17.000Z

Not from my device plan, just my airtime plan because they are picky. Of course they only decide to tell you this days AFTER your bill due date that there is no direct debit so you set one up asap for them to still not take any payment so you get hit with a late fee they can't undo, and also screw your credit score because they are too incompetent to take a direct debit out you set up TWICE.Awful company, can't wait to report this up, company is just scam artists in disguise",Zoey Green,GB,2025-04-02T19:41:47.000Z

1,"After speaking with an agent on Friday, it was advised it would be in my best interest to cancel the upgrade, I had JUST placed and reraise once cancelled. I was advised it would take 1-2 days for this to be processed. On Sunday I followed this up, to be told yes the cancellation had indeed been placed and to wait a further day for it to proces, following procedure. Monday I contacted again, as I had not received a text confirming cancellation, this agent told me again it had been placed but could take a little bit longer to receive confirmation, again I was fine with this. Tuesday came along, still no text. I contact the webchat team AGAIN, to be told by the agent that the upgrade was still showing as active and that they would transfer me to the correct team. The agent on the returns team told me as per the text, I did NOT receive, it would be 2/4 that cancellation would be placed and that I would receive the text confirming. Surprise surprise, that day came and nothing. I contact the team again to be told the cancellation was not placed and that it's fine because it will automatically be cancelled in 3 days. The amount of time I have wasted on my dinner break is disgusting, and no accountability has been taken for the gross miscommunication I have received over the last few days. I will be passing this onto family and friends, and anyone who will listen",Megan Fawkes,GB,2025-04-02T18:53:18.000Z

We got full fibre broadband with Vodafone and every single step of the process has involved literally hours going round in circles on the phone or website with them. Leaving aside the time wasted by the AI agent and voice recognition, both of which are apalling, there is a constant pattern of Vodafone messing up then demanding the very details that they have messed up and not given you before they will speak to you about sorting it.

1,"Ridiculous proforma response, that does not begin to address my problem:Firstly, ""Should the problem persist, we encourage you to reach out to our Broadband teams by calling 0333 304 0191 or by using our Live Chat feature available here: (link given but not permitted in reviews). Our team is ready to assist you and ensure that your concerns are addressed promptly"". I am way past this stage in resolving my problem, which was not addressed, let alone promptly!Secondly, ""please feel free to connect with my team on Facebook at (link given but not permitted in reviews)."" I do not use (anti) social media, so cannot contact in this manner.Thirdly, if you had even started to read my problem, you would have understood (I hope) that the problem has nothing to do with social media, so I have no idea why anyone in Vodafone thought it appropriate that the Social Media Team could even begin to understand the problem, let alone resolve it. It is an IT technical problem, which is why I was communicating with your IT Support team. If you in the Social Media Team are going to take it upon yourselves to resolve IT technical problems, at least read and understand the problem!You are an an extraordinarily inept and inefficient organisation and you must please accept this review as FORMAL NOTICE that I am CANCELLING both my mobile phone and my broadband contracts WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT. I cannot do this via my accounts because, as will know, if you had read all this communication, I cannot access my accounts.If you wish to escalate this matter as an official complaint and have already contacted the Broadband Teams without receiving a satisfactory resolution, please feel free to connect with my team on Facebook at (link given but not permitted in reviews). We are here to help you.Thank you,Vodafone Social Media TeamProblem No.1: I have had a Vodafone mobile contract for some time and, when my broadband contract (with another company) came towards its termination date, I thought it would be sensible to use Vodafone for broadband also. I went through all the necessary and the kit arrived and was installed (although I had to pay a local IT support company to do this. I challenge any IT layman to be able to do this without assistance). This cost alone exceeded the saving I was making by moving broadband supplier to Vodafone. I had to set up a second Vodafone account for the broadband supply.However, I was then unable to access either of the accounts I had/have with Vodafone.Then started the second pain experience ‚Äì being transferred eventually to Vodafone IT Support. I have rarely, if ever, encountered such inept and unhelpful service. This terminated(?) in my being told to try yet another ‚Äòsolution‚Äô, immediately followed by an email stating ‚ÄúHello,Your ticket has been set to Resolved status. If you still require this ticket, you can have it re-opened within the next 15 days upon request.Thank youName RedactedThe Customer Care Team‚ÄùThis is extraordinary ‚Äì how on earth can a problem be defined as ‚Äòresolved‚Äô before the customer has i) attempted the suggested action and ii) notified Vodafone that I can now access both accounts.Problem No.2: I wish to cancel both contracts, but how can I do this without knowing the account numbers or being able to find them out from the accounts themselves.I find myself in a Kafkaesque environment.HELP",Richard Minter,GB,2025-04-02T13:15:04.000Z
1,I would give it a 0. The absolute worst company I have ever seen. All I wanted was to try and upgrade to a new phone but the hassle this has cause me is unimaginable. The customer service people don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about charging me ¬£93 and haven‚Äôt a clue why. On the phone about 3 hours trying to find out why. It was an accident apparently. Nobody is helpful at all they all miserable. Vodafone rang and asked why I wanted to leave and he said ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and hung up HE RUNG ME.,Cerys Morriss,GB,2025-04-02T11:35:51.000Z

1,"Customer care couldn't care less:Vodaphone shut off my wife's phone for no reason on a Sunday morning.She rang to ask why, due to not being able to pass security and no help from the less than useless ( in fact totally obstructive) customer care after a week she was advised to go to the local vodaphone shop.She did this and was told that she couldn't pass security ever with the information they had on the screen.They advised vodaphone that they should turn her phone back on.After 36 hours ( not 24 as they told her) her phone was back on.We give 100% to the vodaphone shop but 0% to vodaphone.They had the gall to send her a text to see how well they had done, when she put all '1' s they asked why they had scored so low.All they had to do was listen back to the ' recorded messages' .An absolutely shoddy performance.",steven collett,GB,2025-04-01T23:48:40.000Z

Only to receive 4 emails and one text to say complete your booking. The ¬£60 voucher they also offer seems some what misleading as when I try to retrieve it it‚Äôs asking me to rebook my broadband I tried to call Vodafone to verify this and there system and chat phone etc is apparently down .

1,"I recently had an issue with my SIM port and visited the Vodafone store in Brent Cross for assistance. Three sales advisors‚Äîtwo males and one female‚Äîattempted to help me, but none could figure out the problem. One of them didn‚Äôt even bother to ask about the issue or try to help. The other two, unable to resolve it, kept telling me to ‚Äúwait 24 hours and come back,‚Äù as if that were a real solution.I don‚Äôt even live near Brent Cross, yet I made the trip twice, hoping for a resolution. On my last visit, I was given an advisor‚Äôs email‚ÄîSabi‚Äîto contact if my SIM still didn‚Äôt work. Unsurprisingly, when I reached out the next day, he completely ghosted me and never responded.When I contacted Vodafone‚Äôs online customer service, they told me to visit a store for help. But if this is the kind of treatment customers receive, what‚Äôs the point? These employees seem more interested in avoiding responsibility than actually helping customers. When I requested to speak to a manager or someone more experienced, I was conveniently told that the assistant manager was the highest authority available‚Äîessentially shutting down any possibility of escalation.It‚Äôs clear that this store prioritizes sales over customer service. If your employees have no interest in solving issues, they shouldn‚Äôt offer false assurances, making customers waste their time and money traveling to the store for nothing. It has now been seven days without a working network, and Vodafone has shown zero accountability.This whole experience has negatively impacted my mental health and disrupted my work, as I have been left without a phone network for a full week. Instead of helping, the staff at this store have only added to my frustration with their pretentious and unprofessional attitude.I strongly recommend avoiding Vodafone, especially this branch. If you value real customer service and reliability, go with any other network‚Äîthis one is a complete disgrace.",Sakshi,GB,2025-04-01T19:50:52.000Z

1,I have been with Vodafone for around 3 or 4 years now . My pay monthly contract ended in September which suited me as I was working away for 6 months. So I went onto a Vodafone pay as you go SIM . I have taken out a new contract with them and asked them to swap my phone number over .I took the contract last week and I am still waiting for my pay as you go number to swapped over .I have spent over 4 hours on the telephone to try and get this resolved. The call centre staff don't know what they are doing . I have had 2 separate emails saying the number will be swapped and it hasn't been .I spent nearly  an hour today with a lady who seemed to know what she was doing . Unfortunately she didn't and I have received more text messages off Vodafone asking for more information.I can't understand why it's taking so long other network swaps have been seemless with other companies. Vodafone is a great network but is unfortunately it's let down by staff that don't know what they are doing .,David Urmston,GB,2025-04-01T17:45:57.000Z

1,"I have no idea where all these excellent reviews have come from. I came back to Vodafone after a break because of poor customer service, I don't know why as since then I have had a catalogue of mistakes. Most recently I have been unable to access mobile data on one of my mobile phones, there is a data bar on the phone which I cannot remove online it says it is removed then toggles back on. This happened back last year and I contacted Vodafone who turned it back on. This is now no longer the case and Vodafone are unable to offer this anymore. Instead they now how to fill out forms to request it is switched back on. These forms take 24 hours maximum, something they confirmed to me by text. 24 hours passed and I still had no data, I used the chat again which is frustrating and awful long you are left with long silences and no reply to be met with an automated message telling you they'll disconnect the chat shortly. I have now spent hours on webchat and also on the phone where I have been told I need to wait a further 48 hours for someone to look at why I have no data. In the meantime I have had to buy a sim from Tesco mobile so I can use my phone for work. Also when I was complaining to Vodafone they tried to upsell me a sim only plan and tried to get me to upgrade my broadband. Neither of which appeals when I have a phone that isn't fit for purpose. I wouldn't recommend Vodafone to anyone, I have broadband, 2 phones, 2 wearables and a tablet and this is the treatment I receieve they literally don't care. I have no resolution to my issue, no-one can tell me what to do apart from 'wait'. I will not be renewing anything with vodafone as they're appalling.",Tara,GB,2025-04-01T16:42:57.000Z

1,"I had applied for Essential Broadband from Vodafone which after applying they would say that they would call you in 5 working days(which is an absolute lie) and that if we don't pick up the call, they would try again in 4 hours(which is also an absolute lie). After 6 working days I received a call. They phone rang for less than 5 seconds and they cut the call. i never received any other call after that. I registered twice after that and weeks have passed. No calls whatsover. If the company is not happy providing an essential broadband service for those in need, then it should not provide one. They just claim that they provide essential broadband just to look good. Pathetic service. Have been using Vodafone mobile for a long time.

1,"If I could zero stars I would. This company have been nothing but incompetent. My uncle has had no end of issues with the wifi connection in his home recently, and it  appears that his router is failing. It turns itself off frequently and we are forever having to unplug it and plug it back in to reboot it. We have been on the phone to them today only to discover their whole customer support workforce is completely incompetent. Absolutely no offer of sending a technician out to look at the rooter to diagnose the issue, and refusing to send out a replacement router. Just keep going round and round in circles telling us everything is fine. My uncle is a vulnerable, disabled pensioner and lives in a very isolated area with no mobile signal‚Ä¶.so he relies on a working internet connection to be able to contact his support network. If something was to happen to him, and the wifi was not working it could quite literally be a life or death situation. Vodafone do not appear to be taking this seriously, and we are now looking to cancel our contract and move over to a company that is focused on providing a quality service.

5,"I had broadband fitted a few weeks ago. The installation was more complicated than normal because fibre has just come to my area and I was on virgin cable before. However, Muhammad was super efficient and had it all up and running in a couple of hours. So far, I can't fault it. The advertised speed of 500mb is actually true! I am so used to Virgin speed being 25% of the speed I was paying through the nose for at busy times of day. In addition, it is nearly 400 upstairs at the other end of a bigger than average house without a booster. So far I'm a happy bunny after suffering Virgin for many many years and paying their extortionate prices for a poor service. I just hope Vodafone customer service is up to scratch if I ever need to use them!",Kat,GB,2025-03-31T09:33:34.000Z
1,"Swapped Sky broadband for Vodafone 'full fibre' this week. Have to say, very underwhelmed. The router Vodafone have provided is awful, can get wifi within about 8 foot of router, outside of that it just drops out. Never had this problem with any broadband provider before (Sky, BT, Now). Tried their online resolutions, speed tests, chat - absolutely useless - keep telling me my broadband is working.

1,"This is honestly the worst provider I have ever been with.  I initially enquired about the broadband and was persuaded to add my 2 mobile phones to the account to receive a Vodafone together discount and save some money.  It has taken 6 months to get the discount applied, having to call their customer services on a monthly basis.  The calls usually take at least one hour as they always have to go and check something with another department. Now I‚Äôve been hit with a 15% increase on the overall plan, which I was lead to believe was about 3% per year on the 1st of April each year.  I‚Äôve only been with them 6 months.  The broadband work was carried out poorly, my brickwork was damaged and the old cables were left hanging from the wall.  Vodafone said this was not there responsibly and I‚Äôd have to take this up with Open Reach.  To date no repairs have been undertaken.  I am overall in a worse position than I was paying for my mobiles and broadband separately and the customer service is terrible, it takes months to get anything sorted.  Don‚Äôt be drawn in by the together discount, it will cost you long term.  I have today been quoted an exit fee of ¬£183.00, so it looks like I‚Äôm stuck with them for another 18 months.  Worst mistake I‚Äôve made‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. UPDATE:  Vodafone asking me to reach out to them, the worst customer service team I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune to contact.  They are totally incompetent!  I would at the very least expect them to call me.  They switched both my mobiles to their Network stating I would be saving money, only now I am paying more.  They don‚Äôt tell you that!  They are a disgrace‚Ä¶.",Tracey Wardle,GB,2025-03-31T19:03:58.000Z

1,"Vodafone were fined ¬£4.6 million pounds in 2016 for serious breaches of the Consumer protection Rules. From my experience they have learnt very little.My Experience!I ordered Vodafone broadband in December 2024 for activation on 14th January 2025. My router was sent but never arrived around the 17th December 2024 and for some reason was returned to Vodafone. I heard nothing from Vodafone, so a week before the date for the line activation, I contacted Vodafone and asked them when my router will arrive as no router, no broadband. They confirmed they had received the original router but did nothing! I reminded them my activation date was on the 14th January 2025 and they said they would expedite delivery on another router. In short the router did not arrive in time and activation was a day late with me without broadband for the 14th January 2025.I complained to them, not easy, and told them I expected some compensation.My bill arrived on the 15th March 2025 and he bill stated that Vodafone were charging me from the 14th January 2025 even though they were aware of their incompetence in ensuring they delivered the service on the agreed date of the 14th January 2025. Unfortunately I was flying to Asia on the 17th February and had no time to contact them thinking that they would act correctly as they were aware of the incorrect bill. I then received an email chasing me for payment on the 3rd March 2025 and 3 days later they disconnected my broadband. Phoning them from Asia was ¬£2 per minute so that was not an option. However on the 8th I contacted them on the chat facility but they were unhelpful and seemed to have difficulty in understanding the situation. On my return I phoned them from the uk and asked them to reconnect the service. They said I would need to pay them first including the time the line had been cut off and they probably would have added a reconnection charge. I decided they were jot a company to give my money too so I ordered a new line with Virginia media. Router and line activated in 4 days. I await contact from Vodafone to return their router and pay them for the time I had their service, from the 15th January to the 3rd March 2025 plus the confirmation.My advice..Do not put up with bad service and do not use Vodafone for any of your communications.Vodafone replied as you can see. Said to DM them with no contact details. They send text and emails to you which you cannot reply to. Pathetic!",DAVID,TH,2025-03-31T07:00:46.000Z

1,"***edit*** Vodafone left the below comment on my review asking me to please get in touch with their complaints team via X or Facebook (does anybody under the age of 35 have an account on either of these platforms?) or call their complaints line. I did the latter, and was assured blindly that I would be connected the following day as initially advertised. I asked how I would be connected without having had a router sent out to me. The woman said I'd also receive the router the following day. I asked why this was suddenly a possibility when my previous requests had provided me no useful information - she said she didn't know but insisted I would be up and running the following day, and even said I would be entitled to compensation (?!) which we could speak about once the service had been established. It is now 7 days later and I have had no communication whatsoever and no modem or router. As a result, Vodafone has now truly earned the coveted 1 star review from me and I am cancelling my order.***Hours spent chasing connection date. The agents are individually polite, but you have to speak to a useless AI bot and beg to be connected to one, and are then passed between 4 or 5 people to try to find an answer. The chat continuously warns you that you haven't replied and that it will shortly terminate, even if you are staring at the screen watching an agent type. When I mentioned this, they asked me to kindly reply once per minute to say 'ok' just so the chat window wouldn't close. What kind of user testing was done on this system? I have been talking for literally hours on 3 occasions at this stage to find out what is going on with my broadband provision. It was supposed to be happening 37 days after I set up my order. I get periodic texts which vaguely imply that my order is being held up, but nothing further.  Vodafone never reach out, so I am forced to contact them every time for an update. Most of the time the agent pastes an update that tends to involve technical terminology and acronyms. I work in tech, so they often have some kind of meaning to me but is this how they speak to non-technical people? It must be quite confusing for normal people to be updated with information like this.The status seems to be that Openreach haven't yet fully provisioned the termination at my address, despite the fact that I placed this order specifically because Openreach emailed me to say that FTTP was available at my address and there are OFS fibre-optic boxes above every flat door in my building. This implies that somewhere, the data is wrong or something is being failed to be communicated properly. Vodafone's solution is to ask me to contact them again in 11 days for an update. I asked if they would contact me instead, since I am a new customer and don't appreciate being asked to continuously chase updates on what should be a simple joining process. They declined. I asked if they are able to notify my current provider not to terminate my service on Monday leaving me without any internet access, they said I would have to do it. In conclusion, I will have been waiting close to 2 months for service to be provisioned by the time I have to next reach out to Vodafone, for an update that to be honest I have very little faith will be any sort of resolution for my problem. I understand that Vodafone's partners appear to be holding up the provision, but to be left in the dark continuously and told to chase information myself is lousy and lazy customer service from the business. It would be totally unacceptable for someone in my line of work to do this to a client, so it's pretty disappointing to experience this as someone who just wants to be able to stream Netflix in HD.",Customer,GB,2025-04-07T07:13:46.000Z

2,"I recently had a very poor experience with Vodafone's customer service. Three months ago, I signed up for broadband, but the third-party installer placed the cable in a very prominent spot on the front of my house without properly explaining how it would look.I contacted Vodafone to request that the third-party provider reposition the router and connection box to improve the cable's appearance. Both Vodafone and the third party were uncooperative, and I had to insist on management intervention, I was told I‚Äôd receive a call within 72 hours from the third party‚Äî which never happened.  After several follow-ups (initiated by me) I was informed it would take up to 10 days, beyond the cooling-off period, so I ultimately cancelled the contract after waiting as long as possible for some communication from the third party. I contacted Vodafone to have the third party remove their tools and cable, as it was no longer needed since I had cancelled the contract (due to the poor service I had received). I was told that returning the router would prompt them to do so. After a week with no response, I called again and was told I‚Äôd have to pay for the removal. I had to insist on the issue being escalated.After multiple calls, emails, and being misinformed, the third party finally removed the cable and tools, five weeks after my initial complaint. Vodafone wanted to close the case, despite not  having refunded my pre-paid bill. I was told I‚Äôd receive a full refund, but only got 52%. When I contacted my customer care rep, I received no response and had to reach out to Vodafone via a different avenue, to understand why. I was told I was charged for the days the service worked. Although I found a clause about non-refundable installation charges, there was nothing indicating I‚Äôd be charged for service within the cooling period. Throughout the process, I made numerous calls and had to repeatedly explain my issue. I was misinformed about how my complaint would be resolved and what refund I‚Äôd receive. I was also told multiple times that the third party would contact me within a certain period, but this never happened. Even using Vodafone‚Äôs online chat, I was passed from pillar to post and had to repeat myself. The process was arduous and unnecessarily complicated with great disconnect and lack of communication between departments. I found Vodafone to be very resistant to taking responsibility for the negligence of their third party and they would have been happy to let the consumer take the hit if I had not insisted. As a result, I will be avoiding Vodafone as a supplier for any of my products in the future. Review update on 13th April: On the 1st of April I received a call from my customer service rep, in response to the email I had sent  week previously, querying why I had not received a full refund. I was advised that I had received 'pro-rata credit' but had been charged for the days the service had been active. I expressed dissatisfaction at this and suggested that a complete refund as I had originally been led to believe, would be a gesture of good will from Vodafone. This has taken a couple of weeks to resolve but in the end I have received receive the full refund. For this reason I have added a star to the review (originally one star) but would not add more as overall the process was lengthy and required the customer to put in a lot of time and effort to achieve a satisfactory solution.",Joanna McCulloch,GB,2025-04-13T20:11:29.000Z

I called/wrote to technical support many hours, I did 10-20 router and box resets as they asked, spent hours with them, each time they said wait 24 hours to receive an update, at the end they said it may take 24-48 hours to get resolved as it was ticketed to City Fibre who came and check everything is OK on their side. Moving to this company is One of the worst decisions in my life. this is not a rocket science, I seriously wonder how they can not activate a simple broadband. Each time you talk to them, they delay another 24 hours. just wasting time, definitely avoid, use ADSL it is far better than this at least you can use internet",AZ,GB,2025-03-29T11:59:22.000Z

1,"Vodafone broadband speed hardly ever reaches the contracted minimum of 400+ Mbps. The download and upload speed vary hugely, from minute to minute, regularly delivering only 0.08 Mbps of upload speed. The support service is useless, continuously recommending to restart the router, even though it does not resolve the issue. One also cannot find a phone number to Vodafone, to discuss the contract they're in breach of. On their website, Vodafone recommend writing a physical letter and sending it to a physical address! Such an approach clearly aims to discourage people to contact Vodafone in a meaningful way.",KLi,GB,2025-03-28T21:41:29.000Z

1,My broadband service was out of service for 2 months due to a broken cable. Service was restored on 21 February 2025 and under Ofcoms compensation scheme I should have received my compensation within 30 calendar day. It is now 35 days since the problem was resolved and I haven‚Äôt received my compensation. Vodafone state that the compensation will be paid between 30 and 60 days. Have complained to Vodafone who now say it will take 6weeks. Obviously Vodafone don‚Äôt understand Ofcoms rules.BT paid my neighbour his compensation within 1 week.The reply from Vodafone to my comments is no different from other replies they have made to adverse comments. No doubt their response was AI generated without any human review.I don‚Äôt use either Facebook or X so their response is meaningless and insincere,Dave,GB,2025-03-28T16:29:10.000Z

1,"I moved my number from EE, which I did not love. Vodafone ended up screwing the move, and I had to pay both of them for a month. They also had the audacity to send me the second bill already. When I contacted support, they told me they are ‚Äúsorry, we don‚Äôt offer refunds or credit‚Äù (what kind of company doesn‚Äôt?) and offered me a 10¬£ voucher to Morrisons! Ahah. First, you screwed up. I had to chase you. Your mistake costed me 30¬£ and half a day to figure out who screwed it up. You offer me 10¬£ to a Morrisons that does not exist in central London? What a joke of a service. RIDICULOUS. Own your mistakes. Leaving for sure, probably back to freaking EE that at least owns it when they screw up.",Asia Kitaichik,GB,2025-03-28T14:44:16.000Z

1,"While I had a business broadband contract with Vodafone, I was treated more like a captive consumer than a valued business customer.Closing the account was deliberately obstructive. There was no straightforward ""non-renewal"" option‚Äîinstead, I was told I had to contact Vodafone exactly 30 days before the end of my contract to avoid renewal. Not before, not after. This is a ridiculous and impractical requirement for any customer, let alone a business one.Over the course of three separate interactions‚Äîvia calls and chat, totalling over 1.5 hours, I was repeatedly subjected to intrusive marketing questions (e.g. who I was switching to, how much I would pay), despite making it crystal clear I only wanted to cancel. Even after I stated clearly and repeatedly that I didn‚Äôt want to discuss alternatives or promotions, Vodafone representatives persisted in trying to upsell me other products (like mobile contracts). It felt deliberately designed to wear me down.In the first two interactions, lasting around 30 minutes each, I was not allowed to cancel, but that didn‚Äôt stop the agents from trying to sell me upgrades. Only on the third attempt was I finally able to terminate the contract.This is not how business customers should be treated. The offboarding experience was obstructive, time-consuming, and frankly, borderline abusive. I don‚Äôt know whether this practice is legal, but it is certainly unethical.I would strongly advise any business considering Vodafone to think twice. You are not treated with professionalism or respect.I will be raising a formal complaint and follow up as needed with the ombudsman.",Andres,GB,2025-03-28T14:21:49.000Z

1,"Dear Vodafone Headquarters,Rating: 0/5I am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment with the service provided by your German branch. My recent experiences have been extremely negative, and I believe they warrant immediate attention and intervention from HQ. Here is a detailed account of the issues I have faced:Silent Charges and SEPA-Lastschrift: Vodafone Germany silently charged me ‚Ç¨87.37 through SEPA-Lastschrift without any prior notification or explanation. Additionally, despite my switch to Telekom on the 14th of March, they charged me the full price of ‚Ç¨39.99 for the entire month. This is unacceptable as I used their services for only half a month.Incompetent Customer Support: When I contacted Vodafone Germany's customer support, the representatives were completely unresponsive and incompetent. Their behavior led me to believe that they were not even affiliated with Vodafone. They wasted my time for hours without providing any real support or solutions.False Promises: During one of my numerous attempts to resolve the issue, I was told to wait for a fake conversation with their supervisor. Eventually, they promised a refund that they claimed was already processed to my Vodafone account and would be transferred to my bank account soon. However, there is no balance in my Vodafone account at all. When I asked for confirmation, they provided none and failed to prove or even acknowledge the payment.Lack of Transparency and Speculative Communication: There was no information available in the customer portal about the mysterious charges. Every time I contacted Vodafone via email, they responded with an SMS asking me to call for explanations. This is clearly a speculative tactic to avoid written documentation that could be used in court. Calls cannot be easily proven, making this strategy a clear sign of cheating and lack of transparency.Inadequate Communication: Vodafone Germany's communication strategy seemed to be designed to deter customers from pursuing their issues. Their SMS and phone call explanations were vague and unhelpful.SEPA-Lastschrift Feature: I recently discovered that I can cancel SEPA-Lastschrift transactions within 8 weeks to get my money back. Now, Vodafone Germany has the audacity to ask me to pay for half of March again! Absolutely infuriating!Poor Technical Competence: The technical competence of Vodafone Germany‚Äôs support is also at the lowest level. Their main solution to any issue is simply to restart the device. There is no stable connection, regardless of the speed offered. It doesn‚Äôt matter at which speed I experience breakdowns of internet connection; what matters is having a reliable service, which Vodafone Germany fails to provide.Unprofessional Conduct: To top it all, a drunk Vodafone Germany employee visited my home, trying to convince me to sign up for double contracts with nonsensical arguments. This kind of behavior is completely unprofessional and unacceptable.Important Advice: Never, never, never trust what they say. Do not waste time on phone calls. Never allow them SEPA-Lastschrift; pay by yourself with transfer. Always ask for confirmations otherwise never confirm anything. Never open the door to Vodafone employees who come without an appointment.Overall, my experience with Vodafone Germany has been extremely negative, and I would advise anyone considering their services to steer clear. They have shown a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction and transparency, and their support is laughably incompetent.Request for HQ Action: I urgently request that Vodafone Headquarters take immediate action to address these severe issues within your German branch. Adequate training, better communication protocols, and transparency are essential to regaining customer trust. Alternatively, I would suggest Vodafone withdrawing from the German market if these issues continue to persist, as they are damaging the brand‚Äôs reputation. Perhaps these issues are deliberate, targeting the German market differently from the UK market. But comparing the ratings (Germany 1.4 vs UK 4.5), it leaves me questioning whether it's paid negligence or a lack of care about the German market.Vodafone needs to seriously address these issues and improve its services if it wants to retain customers. My life would indeed be easier if Vodafone Germany could simply explain their charges and provide genuine support.Feel free to contact me for a more detailed opinion and experience.Sincerely yourth, unsatisfied customer.",Armen,DE,2025-03-28T12:50:44.000Z

1,Tried to buy broadband and order got stuck in basket (could not delete and could not checkout) so tried to call number on error msg screen. Went through a menu of options and they it seemed to be connecting to someone and the line dropped (I was using a Vodafone phone). This happened twice so I tried chat. The chat bot was rubbish as it kept taking me in circles back to ordering online which is where the problem was (Website bug). At one point even the chat bot crashed (I have a screen print). Eventually I seemed to get a human but each time I replied (almost instantly to each message) it took them between 2 and 6 minuets to respond. At the start of my chat I gave all the information including phone number and after quite some time I get asked for my phone number again to send me a verification code. 8 mins later they responded to say that the code would be sent shortly. If this is the customer journey when spending money I dread to think what it would be like if I had a problem with broadband and hence I decided to close the chat and take my business  to a company that cares about customer service.,Ricky,GB,2025-03-27T16:19:20.000Z

No equipment was dispatched even though I chased the team on social media.My installation was for this morning and I have arranged to be at home only to receive a text at midday to say an engineer would not be coming. I cannot reply to the text and I was advised by Vodafone to cancel my existing broadband which means I will have no broadband and no indication of when they will connect me which is shocking when we live in such a connected world.Very stressful experience,Amanda W,GB,2025-03-27T14:30:22.000Z

1,"In the past my data ran out but Vodafone charged me for extra data I didn't want. I contacted them and told them when my data runs out, let it run out without adding extra. It's now happened with my international calls. I told them when I asked for the 100 minutes, if my minutes run out, just cut me off. They didn't do that. They let the minutes run over and are now charging me. Why? Yet at the end of each month if I have data left over, they don't add it to the next month or give me a discount on my bill? Why and Is this fair? When I try to speak to someone, I can't get by a computerised system who keep referring me to go some online site that won't answer my question. I've always been with Vodafone but this petty penny pinching, and its pounds not pennies, has made me start looking elsewhere.",Hughie McCullough,GB,2025-03-27T13:44:48.000Z

1,"I used this provider for many years, and they were once reliable. However, Vodafone has become increasingly greedy as a commercial service and no longer prioritises its customers. The problems began when the network provider failed to verify my new direct debit details for my personal account.The app is practically useless, riddled with errors, and their technical support team is of no help in resolving the network‚Äôs internal issues. Customer service is equally frustrating‚Äîthey employ manipulative tactics, shifting the blame onto the customer or insisting that your handset is the issue.Vodafone‚Äôs EU roaming coverage is also declining. Many of the so-called ‚Äúpositive‚Äù reviews seem questionable, suggesting the company may be encouraging favourable feedback to mask its unethical practices.Thankfully, my contract has now ended, and I‚Äôll be looking for a more affordable and reliable provider.

Chose Vodafone, entered my details, but got a ""Something wrong with your personal details""??? Went to chat, poor customer service tried to help... tried ID check with TSB, Starling Bank and AMEX... all failed.Context: Over the last 12 months I successfully applied to all those banks and most recently sailed through a Barclaycard application. No issues.Customer Service gave up. Asked me to go in-store and bring passport and proof of address. I said no... all this hassle to join Vodafone?Twenty minutes later I had a confirmed delivery arriving today, for a brand new S25 Ultra, similar airtime package from their biggest rival... guess what - no issues.Their ID system is losing high value customers... and they wonder why their commercial performance is tanking...",Jeroen van den Oever,GB,2025-03-27T10:16:13.000Z
1,An update on Vodaphone/open reach complaint on 25th March from me about 3 week rescedule and no turn up install after 6 hour wait. Vodaphone immediately got in touch after it went public with Trustpilot. Saying an investigation will take place within. 7-10 days. I replied not good enough after 7 week installation wait. They apologised and just repeated yes delayed and no turn up in 1.5 days. Thanks trustpilot. I cancelled complete and returned unnpowered hub to high street shop. They told me its not vodaphone but open reach fault therefore no apology. All my text email install dates were signed by VODAPHONE.I suggest you close your business and reopen under Notophone a confectionary business selling porky pies. Also open reach re open as hoping reach dressed with big flat shoes and bright red noses. Just turn up for the interview. Oops you cant do that.,David Houghton,GB,2025-03-27T07:22:05.000Z

1,"Just left vodafone after my 2 year contract came to an end, never again will I be involved with this provider, the fact that they would continue to charge you the same monthly price they were charging for your device and plan even after you have your device paid off over your two year contract is scandalous and should not be allowed, in other words had I not told them I wouldn't be renewing my contract they would have carried on taking the same monthly price even though my device was paid off. Customer care is non existing and the chance of getting to speak to an English person who you can understand is also non existing, im so glad to get away from them and now with a much better provider with excellent customer care, I can't give -0 stars so it'll have to be 1 unfortunately, good riddance  and ""NO"" in response to vodafones response to this rating I wont be reaching out to you, as it states in my rating I am only to glad to get away from you to a far superior provider at a realistic cost, I only wish I had done it sooner, people take my advice from personal experience and DO NOT enter into a contract with these cowboys!!",Michael Graham,GB,2025-03-27T11:03:19.000Z

1,Very poor coverage on my daily commute. The only reason I am using Vodafone is because my work location has a Vodafone mast nearby and the other operators don't or are far away. Otherwise my daily commute consists of no signal for at least 20 miles (consistently inexistent on the motorway). The M5 in particular and the SouthWest area is very bad for Vodafone users.

1,My broadband connection has been intermittent for three weeks now. I have spent over twenty five hours on the phone and in online chat with them.  Utterly incompetent technical support. Impossible to communicate with on a meaningful way. Deliberately obstructive. I would suggest that you don‚Äôt sign a contract with these people. You will regret it. I‚Äôve just seen their response below - and it is utterly typical of my experience that their suggestion to solve my problem with their incompetent tech support is to call their tech support. I‚Äôve moved to Zen. And in an afternoon have achieved more that I did in six weeks with Vodagoons.,Consumer,GB,2025-04-09T18:37:45.000Z

1,"PLEASE READ THIS WHEN THINKING OF SIGNING UP.Ignore how much the monthly payments are, as this is neglibable compared to the amount you will pay overall. Your phone will go out of contract. You will suddenly start getting charged huge amounts over the odds for the same service. You will go to a comparison site, get a new deal. Then try to contact Vodafone to get a PAC code to move your number. They will purposely make this impossible for you to get. I had to answer 5 security questions, like which month and year did my contract start, and how manyt connections do i have (my kids have them on my account but i have no idea). You then cancel direct debit as they are taking out more money each month. You cant cancel it the vodafone account though without answering the security questions. So next thing you get a letter saying you owe ¬£100's and it affects your credit rating. You end up paying more than the years contract just to get rid of them.

1,"Outright lied. Asked to cancel, was told it would be free. I set up a new contract and received a confirmation email confirming my contract with Vodafone was ending and would cost ¬£0 to terminate. This is after endless issues, multiple problems with one person saying one thing and then another person telling me that I should have known that they didn't really mean that and it was up to me to research what it actually meant. A full month later with no warning, no bill, no contact at all, I am charged over ¬£150 for terminating the contract. When I call them, again - it's well even though we told you twice it was free, you should have known that it wasn't. Complete scam. Horrible attitude. No empathy a single time I called.

I believe I was speaking to technical support in Egypt.

1,"Got full fibre broadband installed from them. I was told it was the fastest speed I would be able to get. Turned out to be slower than what I was currently getting from BT. Cancelled less than 24 hours into contract. Vodafone still took off the full amount and then had the cheek to tell me I wouldn't get a full refund as it was active for 7 days. The router was in transit back to them for 5 days so charged for sending their router back to them. Best thing is they kept telling me to give it 14 days to ""settle"" but big difference between 910Mbs and 430Mbs. If I had done that I would have either been tired into the contract for 24 months or had to pay the full month. Nice scam to get free money from people. Last time I go anywhere near this absolute rip off disgusting dishonest company.Live chat states that I will get a partial refund when next bill is produced. Checked my account and it specifically states that no future bills will be produced. What this means is that I will not get ANY refund as they have considered it closed. Told BT about this and they upgraded my speed (now twice what Vodafone claimed was the fastest I could get) and reduced my bill. At least decent companies still exist.***UPDATE***Vodafone replied to this to contact them to sort it. This basically involves contacting them to be told I am correct. I have to pay for the days that the router is in transit despite having no way of accessing the internet and if it takes 3 day or 10 days then that's tough and you have to pay until they receive the router as they don't disconnect until they do. Please be aware anyone that if you are not satisfied then I would not listen to their customer service and wait the 14 days for it to ""settle"" as there is a good chance you will end up tied into a 2 year contract if there is a delay in the router getting back to them.",Chas,GB,2025-03-26T19:18:08.000Z

1,"Vodaphone managed to cancel my direct debit in December 2024, 2 emails sent notifying me of subsequent payments due went into junk and I didn't see them. Only discovered as went online to cancel the account, saw monies owed and tried to call to get to bottom of what went wrong. After over an hour having been put on hold, cut off twice, had to call back, I decided that life was too short and just paid the late payment fee & monies owed. Then got a call back from vodaphone, I explained that contract is up in 2 months ( for sim in electric gates ¬£5.37/month) and just wanted to pay to end and not renew the contract. Told that I could only cancel by phone, another wait to be put through to relevant department.Then told cancellation only possible if they send a code to sim number in the gates which doesn't receive texts!! I have another number logged with vodaphone for security which I use for online log in but apparently they couldn't send code to this. She suggested I take the sim out of gates, put it in another phone, I explained that I don't have any old phones lying around, she was adamant that was the only way it could be done. Refused to put me through to anyone else.",L W,GB,2025-03-26T14:45:01.000Z

4,"Vodafone are so bad on both broadband and landline. Their phone staff outside the UK don't seem to understand basic issues. They are poor on sorting basic problems and would rather lose customers than sort problems. They rarely accept responsibility when it is clearly their fault. As a customer of twenty years, they binned me off rather than give me a few GBs when my mobile data allowance went in five days. Yet we have their broadband at-home which should mean it not happening. They are awful at problem solving. What's happened vodafone? You used to be brilliant. Now you are s****!I would like to add that Vodafone have resolved my issue. To be fair they do seem to care once you push them. It was a weird problem.The home broadband was working well yet when I used my phone, at home, it still ate up my data allowance! I did not even watch any films, or high GB things.

1,"This is an update 30 March 25,I was left holding for 40minutes.Interestingly, as I am writing this review a team attempted to call me x2 whilst holding on for a technician!!!Avoid Vodafone. This is probably the worst network provider in Bedford. The team members in Bedford store are very good. ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê Sadly the network in the area appears to be extremely poor.  Initially a report stated they had good net work coverage. Sadly this is not true. (My broadband service box arrived on the day of the 2 week  cooling of period). And have been locked into their contract.  Frequently I'm unable to make calls indoors/home.The customer service unnecessarily protracted and even more so when you request for a Puk number to leave the network. Their policy appears to lock their unhappy  customer into bondage.  The technical team try to prevent customers leaving insisting on carrying troubshooting tests. Reinforcing  the difficulties of leaving the networkIf a customer decides to leave a termination fee 135 pounds is then required this then as more frustration to the customer.On 25 March I terminated the call after waiting for a technician  to sort out my issue..the matter still remains outstanding.The saga continues!!The network service is poor..error message ""unregistered calls"" or not connected to Internet/wifi and unable to have a conversation without the line dropping several times. üò§ Ironically when I requested to make a direct complaint my network remained quite strong ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Pam,GB,2025-03-29T16:48:48.000Z

1,"I have been with Vodafone for a few years with both my broadband and sim. They offered for me to upgrade to fibre broadband which they told me alike be faster than my broadband at the time. It wasn‚Äôt. In fact when I changed providers because it was so slow I was told that Vodafone don‚Äôt even yet have the rights to full fibre in my area yet. I tried to complain but the technical support team practically laughed at me and denied that I had ever been sold fibre (I have an email which confirms this). I cancelled my contract as soon as I could get out of it and gave 30 days notice. I received emails from Vodafone to confirm that they were sorry to see me leave. Two months later I was shocked to see that Vodafone had taken ¬£26 out of my account. When I called to complain, they firstly tried to tell me that I hadn‚Äôt given notice and when I told them I had emails to confirm this they backtracked and told me it was a valid payment.

Before I move into a new house, I have called up the customer service and requested to move the broadband connection to my new house.1st Call: I have been transferred to 3 different agents. 1st agent told me that they don't provide service in the new address(even though I have moved to a different address in the same town). 2nd agent told me that they do provide the service in the new address, but told me they can't continue the existing contract and I have to go for a new 24months contract(even though I have been told I can move my connection to new address with the existing contract when I took the contract). 3rd agent again said that they don't provide service in that area. This whole conversation took about 1hr 50min. I had to end the call due to some personal reasons.2nd Call: This time only one agent(Dexter) - But, he told me they don't do the premise move and offered me a new contract for 24Months with higher prices. I was shocked to know that they don't do premise move and trying to upsell.Since I needed internet, I agreed to go for a new contract and requested for the same price. Dexter said he will check with his manager about the price and get back to me later that day or by next day.I have waited for 3days and no one called me.3rd Call: I have called them to check the status. I have been told that the previous agent(Dexter) had run the credit check(without my consent) and it has been rejected and now they will not provide me with a new contract either. The agent asked me to cancel the contract. I have requested for call transfer to their supervisor. But I have been told that they can't do that, but they will raise a request for a call back from supervisor in less than 48 hours.I have waited for 6days and nothing happened(I have already moved to a new house by this time without internet)4th Call: Different agent(Jam) - I got fed up and requested to cancel the contract. But, the agent said she can't do that as there is an action pending on my account(supervisor call). She has told me that she will speak to the previous agent and arrange a call back in one hour(at this point I have lost the trust on Vodafone and their customer service). This never happened. 5th Call: Different Agent - I have explained the situation. He asked me the details of new house trying to run the credit check again without knowing it has already been done. I have then asked him, not to run the credit check and just cancel the contract. HE HAS DONE IT without any cancellation fee.DON'T go for VODAFONE unless you want a stressful house move and rude customer service.Customer Service agents will say ""We understand your situation"", when they actually don't.",Jeevan Reddy,GB,2025-03-25T14:22:17.000Z

1,"Oh how ironic. Having experienced weeks of really poor quality Wi-Fi and regular broadband drop-outs (I'm supposed to be on Full Fibre 150), I tried the 'Vodafone Broadband Service test' on their website yesterday. Twice during the test the broadband signal dropped out and eventually the test 'froze' on the final part - presumably telling me I'm not getting what I'm paying for. Does anyone at Vodafone want to speak to me regarding this matter? That's a firm 'no' as they claim everything is running as it should - well not from where I'm sitting it isn't. Promises, promises and then failed delivery. One day I'll learn not to believe what they tell me. Renew my contract? Not a chance after this.Update following Vodafone's reply. I called the number as requested (25/4/25). They ran all of their tests. Solution? I need to upgrade to a higher package with a new 24 month contract. Essentially they are telling me (without actually telling me) my 6 month old router probably isn't up to the job and if I pay a bit more, get better equipment and start again - it'll all be fine. Great news. Also - they tell me I can't plug someone else's Wi-Fi boosters into the system -  I can only use Vodafone's boosters. I declined their generous offer. Worst case, I'll just have to pay up the contract and move on. First and last time with Vodafone though. So disappointing.",KJ,GB,2025-04-25T16:22:30.000Z

1,"I requested a home broadband upgrade to Full Fibre 910 Broadband on February 18, 2025, and scheduled the inspection between 8:00 and 13:00 on March 25, 2025. I received an official contract on February 18, 2025, and the order number is SBL-1000000772627539.Since no one contacted me regarding the inspection on or before March 25, 2025, I reached out to your online customer service. The agent informed me that there was indeed an upgrade request, but it had been canceled without any explanation.First, I had scheduled a broadband inspection for that day, but there was no communication or notification. I only found out that it had been canceled after I inquired. This resulted in a waste of my time, as I had waited for over a month for the engineer‚Äôs inspection.Secondly, why was the contract canceled without any explanation? I was simply told to reapply at a higher price.I feel that this completely disregards the spirit of the contract.I have a formal contract with clearly stated terms that should be honored. If a customer fails to comply, your company would demand compensation. So why is it acceptable for your company to unilaterally breach the contract?My request is very simple ‚Äî just to honor our contract. I should not have to reapply at a higher price.",KL,GB,2025-03-25T13:38:56.000Z

1,"I recently decided to switch to Vodafone for broadband services after hearing good things about the company. However, I encountered an unexpected and frustrating issue with their credit check process that has left me very dissatisfied. While I understand that credit checks are part of the application process, I was surprised to be rejected despite having a strong credit score. I regularly monitor my credit and ensure my bills are paid on time. My latest Experian score is 975 out of 999, which reflects my commitment to maintaining good financial health.The reason I applied with Vodafone was to manage broadband for my family, particularly helping my parents with their technology needs. My mum is partially blind, and I decided to take the lead on managing their broadband services to ensure they have reliable access to the internet and support with any technical issues. To be rejected based on a credit check was disappointing, especially when I know my financial standing is more than adequate, particularly considering other companies do not require a credit check for broadband. Internet access is increasingly viewed as a necessity, not a luxury, due to its vital role in education, work, communication, and accessing essential services‚Äîespecially after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted its crucial role. I was informed that I could appeal the decision, which I did, outlining the reasons behind my application, including my strong credit score and the fact that I have dyslexia, which may have caused errors on my application form. However, after appealing, I received an email stating that my application had been reviewed and would remain declined because I had not met the minimum criteria to progress. This response felt dismissive, and I couldn't help but feel that my disability and the reasoning I provided had been completely ignored.Instead of just rejecting my application, I would have appreciated more transparency, flexibility, or at least a chance to review the situation further. It‚Äôs frustrating to feel like my good credit record and valid reasoning weren‚Äôt enough to warrant a second look, especially when the appeal process felt like a formality rather than a genuine review. Overall, I expected better service from Vodafone, and the credit check rejection has left a very negative impression. I‚Äôm reconsidering my choice of broadband provider and would caution others who might have similar experiences.",Anonymous,GB,2025-03-25T03:17:37.000Z

1,Very disappointed to be honest. Me and my husband have been customers for years now and upgraded our phone plan to the newer iPhones.

1,I was phoned the day before my full fibre broadband was due to be installed by a group saying they were Openreach / Vodafone. They convinced me they needed to check the existing speed.

1,"So I just went to the customer services to ask about the end of my contract. When I first started with Vodafone I also signed up to get a pay as you go SIM card to get a second line but when it arrived the number had clearly been cloned as someone hacked my accounts using the number as I put it in my phone. So I‚Äôve been waiting 11 months more or less for this contract to end. Which it does in four days. I asked for information about cancelling the contract, to see if I can terminate it or get it to just not renew: not only was the service agent super slow but they didn‚Äôt listen to what I wanted and tried to terminate early and therefore charge me for early termination, despite my repeatedly saying I will wait if I have to but can it automatically switch off etc.Appalled and can‚Äôt stand them.

1,"Don't be misled into thinking that Vodafone provides good customer service. Their support is based in India, and the advisors often have strong Indian accents. Everything they say is not backed up in writing, as they claim to be ""not authorized"" to provide confirmations. For example, one advisor provided a broadband connection date, but just two minutes later, an email was sent with a different connection date, which was a week later‚Äîthis seems to be an attempt to entice you. When you question the date change, they blame another provider without mentioning that a third-party connection service is in control. Vodafone even sent an email cancelling the new connection, again blaming the current supplier despite their previous service promises. , they promise dates and then shift the blame to others to gain business.It's time wasted and not good business practice, and you pay for the privilege.",Paul Felton,GB,2025-03-24T18:17:20.000Z

1,"I have received an email from Vodafone with an offer to upgrade my broadband as my contract is going to finish soon. I wanted to upgrade my speed. I went through a chat with an agent, agreed an upgrade and received a new ultra hub a few days later. Meantime they contacted me telling me my upgrade has been cancelled due to a technical issue. I went on a chat again, got slightly better price and agreed the upgrade again. A few days later they contacted me telling me my upgrade has been cancelled again because it has been put through with a wrong landline number - clearly an agent error again. I contacted them 3rd time, this time I have got worse deal then the previous 2. The person was absolutely ignorant. Clearly talking to someone else during the chat as it took her long time to respond. When I told her I'm going to leave Vodafone because I have enough, she tried to sell me a SIM card contract because ""perhaps someone can use it on my account"". Shocking customer service. Additionally half of my home devices stopped to work with this new ultra hub. I'm happy my contract ends soon and I can find another provider.Edit: Stope telling people to reach you out if cannot even offer an upgrade to an EXISTING customer because of your incapable employees.
